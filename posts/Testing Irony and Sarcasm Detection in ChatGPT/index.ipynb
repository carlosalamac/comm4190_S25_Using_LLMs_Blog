    "description: I’ve used ChatGPT for plenty of things — summarizing readings, writing emails, generating ideas — but I’ve never tried to build something with it. So for this post, I decided to test GPT’s programming chops by asking it to help me build a playable game from scratch (P.S. I have 0 experience coding whatsoever).\n",

    "Sarcasm is one of those things that makes language wonderfully human… and annoyingly hard for machines to get right. So I decided to test how well GPT-4 can recognize — and generate — sarcasm.\n",

    "Can it tell when I’m being ironic? Can it be ironic on purpose? And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n"

    "###  The Experiment\n",
    "I started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Me:***\n",
    "- “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.”\n",
    "- “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\n",
    "\n",
    "***GPT-4:***\n",
    "- “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Nailed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried again with something trickier:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Me:***\n",
    "- “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.”\n",
    "- “What tone is this?”\n",
    "\n",
    "***GPT-4:***\n",
    "- “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\n",
    "\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "Sarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: ***LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it.*** If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n"

    "### 🧠 Final Thoughts\n",
    "I wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\n",
