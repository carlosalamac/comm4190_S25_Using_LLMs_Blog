    "### Creativity or Collage? How LLMs Actually Work\n",
    "Large language models like GPT-4 are trained on billions of words pulled from books, websites, social media, and more. When they respond to you, they’re essentially predicting the next most likely word or phrase based on patterns in the data.\n",
