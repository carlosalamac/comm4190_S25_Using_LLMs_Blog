    "Carlos is a Dominican student at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Economics and History with a minor in Urban Real Estate and Development. He has extensive experience in finance, including internships in investment banking at Valumonics, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan. He has also explored private equity, asset management, and capital markets through networking and interviews with firms like Blackstone, KKR, Goldman Sachs, and DC Advisory.\n",

    "Carlos is actively involved in finance-related clubs, including the Wharton Latino Investment Team, which he co-founded, and the Wharton Marketing Undergraduate Student Establishment Club. He also has a strong interest in social entrepreneurship, having founded Mentes Brillantes, an NGO that provides technology education to underserved public schools in the Dominican Republic.\n",

    "Beyond finance, Carlos enjoys aviation, chess, renewable energy, Formula One, and vintage watches. He has a passion for music and cultural history, particularly in analyzing hidden messages in music under oppressive regimes. Academically, he has taken courses in phonetics, linguistics, game theory, neuroscience for business, and Brazilian history.\n",

    "If it’s a networking event, it’s a space where professionals come together to exchange insights, build relationships, and explore potential collaborations.

The key is to approach them with confidence, preparation, and curiosity.\n",
