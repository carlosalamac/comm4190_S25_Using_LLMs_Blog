    "### What Are Multimodal LLMs?\n",
    "“Multimodal” means the model takes in and outputs more than one mode of information. Traditional LLMs like GPT-3 only handled text. But now, GPT-4 Turbo (and other models like Gemini 1.5 and Claude) can take inputs such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images (e.g. \"What’s happening in this photo?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Audio (e.g. \"Transcribe or summarize this recording.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diagrams, screenshots, or charts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code snippets, PDFs, and videos (in some models)\n",

Some are walking by, while others are stopping to enjoy the performance. The scene conveys a blend of urban rush and spontaneous artistry.”\n",
