    "description: \"AI-generated images have made significant progress in realism and artistic detail, but one persistent issue remains: generating accurate text on images. Whether it‚Äôs a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL¬∑E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\"\n",

    "## **Why This Matters for AI-Generated Images**\n",
    "This isn‚Äôt just about fixing a tie. Gemini Flash is redefining AI‚Äôs ability to edit images while maintaining photorealism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three major reasons why this is a game-changer:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. True AI Editing Instead of Re-Creation\n",
    "Most LLM-based image generators tend to redraw images from scratch instead of making subtle, controlled changes. This is a major flaw when trying to refine a real photo rather than generate something completely new.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini Flash is showing that AI can be used for professional-grade photo adjustments‚Äîmeaning AI is closer than ever to replacing Photoshop for everyday edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Text-to-Image Generation Is Scaling at an Insane Pace\n",
    "I‚Äôve written previous blog posts on AI text-to-image generation, and it‚Äôs shocking how fast AI models like Gemini are improving. In just a few months, we‚Äôve gone from:\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Basic inpainting** (DALL¬∑E struggled with keeping elements consistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **More controlled edits** (MidJourney introduced small tweaks but lacked precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Fully realistic photo modifications** (Gemini Flash does it cleanly)\n",
    "\n",
    "If this trend continues, we‚Äôre likely heading toward real-time, on-the-fly AI image manipulation, where you can adjust facial expressions, clothing details, and even backgrounds without compromising realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. AI Image Editing Is Becoming More Accessible\n",
    "Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîmost people don‚Äôt know how to use Photoshop, and even if they do, it‚Äôs time-consuming. AI tools like Gemini Flash are making high-quality photo editing available to anyone, regardless of skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Fixing old photos** with minor tweaks (without warping the whole image)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Adjusting professional images** without paying an editor\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **On-demand creative edits** (e.g., altering outfits, expressions, or even entire settings)"
