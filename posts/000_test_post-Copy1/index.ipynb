    "One of the more entertaining things Iâ€™ve tested with different AI models is how they compare themselves to each other. If you ask them directly, do they think theyâ€™re better? Will they confidently say yes, or will they dodge the question? Hereâ€™s what I found."

    "ChatGPT: That depends on how you define \"better.\" If we're talking about general-purpose reasoning, nuanced conversation, and broad knowledge application, I likely still hold an edge over DeepSeekâ€™s models. OpenAI has spent years refining training methods, alignment, and response quality, making me well-suited for complex discussions, coding help, financial analysis, and creative writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, DeepSeek has strengths, especially in its open-source nature. Open-source models allow for more transparency and customization, whereas I operate within OpenAIâ€™s closed ecosystem. Some users might prefer DeepSeek for specific tasks where they can fine-tune the model themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, \"better\" depends on what you need. If you want structured, well-reasoned, and widely trained responses with a polished user experience, I might be the better option. If you want a customizable AI with more flexibility (and donâ€™t mind potential limitations in content filtering or response quality), DeepSeek could be an interesting alternative.\n",

    "**ChatGPT** is confident and will say itâ€™s better (at least in general terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude** avoids taking sides and sticks to a neutral stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DeepSeek** is humble and straight-up says it's not better than GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, are they better than each other? That depends on what you're looking for. But if you're looking for a direct answerâ€”ChatGPT is the only one that gave a straight-up \"yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, can we really take its word for it? Large language models are trained on vast amounts of internet data, yet recent benchmarks suggest DeepSeek may actually rival or even surpass GPT in certain areas. If thatâ€™s the case, is ChatGPT's confidence justified, or is it simply biased toward its own perceived superiority? Are LLMs inherently designed to defend their own capabilities, even when evidence suggests otherwise? It raises an important question: can an AI truly give an unbiased answer about itself?"
