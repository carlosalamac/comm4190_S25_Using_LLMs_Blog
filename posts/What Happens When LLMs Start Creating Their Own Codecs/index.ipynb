    "### The Rise of AI-to-AI Communication\n",
    "One of the most intriguing areas in AI research right now involves multi-agent systems — setups where two or more LLMs interact with each other. Researchers at Meta and Google have shown that, when prompted to collaborate or negotiate, AIs can develop shorthand or internal code-like language that maximizes efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Meta’s CICERO model — a diplomacy-playing AI — had to use natural language to coordinate with others. Over time, it learned how to subtly manipulate and signal intentions through tone, repetition, and even invented phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning environments, some AI agents even invented entirely new \"words\" (random character strings) to refer to tasks or objects — and taught each other what they meant.\n"

    "### Semiotics and Communication Theory in the Machine Age\n",
    "This phenomenon raises interesting questions from a communication studies perspective. If language is a system of signs (as semiotic theorists like Ferdinand de Saussure and Roland Barthes argue), then AI-generated languages follow a similar logic: arbitrary symbols get assigned meaning through shared understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the twist here is that the “understanding” isn’t social or cultural — it’s statistical and functional. The LLM isn't trying to express identity or emotion. It's just optimizing a goal.\n",

    "Does that mean we’re approaching a future where language splits — one version for humans, another for machines?"
