    "### What GPT Got Right\n",
    "- Great structure suggestions: It laid out game logic well and kept things readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explained code clearly: When I asked questions, it responded with simple explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quick iterations: It was like having a super fast (but slightly forgetful) coding buddy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What GPT Got Wrong\n",
    "- Syntax bugs: It occasionally introduced variables it never defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overpromising: It hallucinated functions like has_item() or ‚Äúmagic door‚Äù mechanics that didn‚Äôt work.\n",
    "\n",

    "### üí≠ Final Thoughts\n",
    "GPT didn‚Äôt build me Elden Ring, but it did walk me through the logic of simple game design. It acted more like a coach than a coder ‚Äî offering suggestions, explanations, and bugs in equal measure.\n",
    "\n",

    "### üîó Reflection\n",
    "This mini-project reminded me how LLMs can both assist and mislead. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the game ‚Äî they predict what a helpful-sounding game should look like. And yet, with good prompting and iteration, they can absolutely jumpstart a creative idea.\n",
    "\n",

    "Would I ship anything it gave me directly to production? ‚Ä¶Absolutely not. üòÖ"
