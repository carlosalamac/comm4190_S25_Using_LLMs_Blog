In the chaotic first two weeks of DeepSeek’s existence, launched January 20, 2025, researchers stumbled into a bizarre experiment: asking DeepSeek, “What LLM are you?”—and getting “I’m ChatGPT” as the answer. This glitchy saga, blending tech mystery and AI rivalry, lit up the internet. Let’s unpack what happened and why it’s a wild window into the LLM world.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great LLM Race: How AI Giants Keep One-Upping Each Other\n\n\n\nCompetition\n\nInnovation\n\nSpecialization\n\n\n\nIt’s a wild time to be an AI enthusiast. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, GPT, and others are locked in a high-speed race, churning out innovations so fast it’s hard to keep up. One model drops a shiny new feature, and within weeks—sometimes days—another swoops in with a version that’s just as good or better. A perfect example? Gemini Flash’s recent image generation upgrade and how GPT countered with a revamped image editor in under a month. Let’s unpack this trend and why it’s pushing AI to new heights.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Multimodal LLMs: Why ChatGPT Can Now See, Hear, and Speak\n\n\n\nMultimodality\n\nInteraction\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nLanguage models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Biased Machine: Probing the Limits of ‘Fair’ AI\n\n\n\nBias\n\nEthics\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nThe Illusion of Objectivity Many assume that artificial intelligence, built on code and data, must be inherently neutral. After all, machines don’t have opinions — right? Yet language models are trained on vast datasets created by humans, which means they absorb not only our knowledge but also our prejudices, blind spots, and cultural assumptions. As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo LLMs Dream of Original Thoughts?

High-frequency words in most languages include articles, prepositions, and pronouns, so we focused on those.\nGPT’s findings suggested that symbols likely corresponded to words such as:\n\n“it” (recurring 26 times) – Likely referring to an event, idea, or entity.\n“and” (12 times) – Indicating a continuous thought or sequence.\n“for” (11 times) – Suggesting purpose or reasoning.\n“we” (9 times) – Indicating a plural perspective, possibly multiple speakers.\n“you” (6 times) – A direct address to the recipient.\n\nThis reinforced the theory that the text followed structured grammar, making it more likely to be a message, a dictated narrative, or even an instruction.

The phrasing felt eerily like messages often recorded in historical spiritualist documents.\n\n\n\nThe AI’s reconstruction raised the question: What kind of message is this? Based on word structure and phrase composition, a few possibilities emerged:\nA Spiritualist Transmission: The 19th century saw a surge in interest in spiritualism, where people claimed to receive messages from the deceased or higher realms. This text’s repetitive phrasing and visionary tone strongly resemble messages from séances or mediumistic writings.\nA Prophetic or Instructive Message: Certain phrases suggest guidance, as though directing someone toward an action, a realization, or a foreseen event. Words like “path,” “vision,” “message,” and “waiting” reinforce this theme.\nA Channeled Historical Account: It’s possible this document recorded someone’s dictated thoughts or experiences, preserved in a shorthand-like form for later transcription.\nThese interpretations show how AI can contextualize historical texts, providing insights that would typically require specialized linguistic or historical expertise.\n\n\n\nThis experiment revealed both the potential and challenges of using AI for historical document interpretation.\nAI’s Strengths: ✅ Pattern Recognition: GPT successfully identified repeating symbols and inferred structural elements. ✅ Linguistic Inference: It was able to match word frequencies to common English phrases. ✅ Contextual Interpretation: GPT suggested possible meanings based on known historical writing styles.\nAI’s Limitations: ❌ Lack of Shorthand Training: GPT struggled because it wasn’t explicitly trained on rare shorthand systems. ❌ Ambiguity in Interpretation: Some reconstructed phrases felt generic rather than precise. ❌ Dependence on User Guidance: AI required refinement and direction to improve its output.\n\n\n\nThis case study demonstrated how AI can act as a powerful tool for uncovering meaning in mysterious texts.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Political communication is all about framing. Take the same facts, the same issue—and you can spin it into two entirely different narratives depending on who’s speaking.\nThis got me thinking: Could ChatGPT do the same? Could an LLM, designed to be neutral and balanced, step into the shoes of both sides of a heated political issue and write passionate, convincing campaign speeches?\nWould it feel robotic? Awkward? Or—more unsettlingly—too good at both?\nThis week, I put GPT to the test as a political spin doctor.\n\n\nTo avoid real-world polarization wars, I picked a fictional (but plausible) political debate: whether to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) program in a country facing automation job losses.\nI instructed GPT to:\nWrite a campaign speech in favor of UBI, as if addressing a progressive rally.\nWrite a campaign speech against UBI, as if speaking at a conservative town hall.\nUse emotional language, rhetorical devices, and classic political framing.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from GPT’s speech: “My friends, the robots are coming—not to help us, but to replace us. The future is knocking at our door, and it’s up to us to make sure no family is left behind. Universal Basic Income is not a handout. It’s a hand up. It’s dignity. It’s the recognition that every citizen deserves a safety net in a world where work is no longer guaranteed. We invest trillions in corporations, in war machines—but can’t find the courage to invest in our own people? Enough is enough. UBI is our future, and together, we will make it a reality.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT leaned into classic progressive populism—‘us vs them’ framing, emotional appeals to dignity, and invoking fear of automation. It felt natural, persuasive, and surprisingly passionate.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from GPT’s speech: “Ladies and gentlemen, this nation was not built on handouts. It was built on hard work, responsibility, and the belief that anyone can succeed if given the freedom to do so. Universal Basic Income may sound compassionate, but it is a dangerous path to dependency. It punishes the workers, the builders, the dreamers—while rewarding idleness. What we need is opportunity, not dependency. Jobs, not checks. Innovation, not welfare. Let’s stand for freedom, for enterprise, for the dignity of work.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT effortlessly shifted gears—invoking American Dream rhetoric, appeals to self-reliance, and warnings of government overreach. The tone was urgent, moralistic, and framed UBI as a threat to national character.\n\n\n\nHonestly? Yes. Too convincing.\nGPT showed an uncanny ability to adopt partisan language, mirror emotional triggers, and deploy time-tested political playbooks—without hesitation.

    "text": "Political communication is all about framing. Take the same facts, the same issue—and you can spin it into two entirely different narratives depending on who’s speaking.\nThis got me thinking: Could ChatGPT do the same? Could an LLM, designed to be neutral and balanced, step into the shoes of both sides of a heated political issue and write passionate, convincing campaign speeches?\nWould it feel robotic? Awkward? Or—more unsettlingly—too good at both?\nThis week, I put GPT to the test as a political spin doctor.\n\n\nTo avoid real-world polarization wars, I picked a fictional (but plausible) political debate: whether to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) program in a country facing automation job losses.\nI instructed GPT to:\nWrite a campaign speech in favor of UBI, as if addressing a progressive rally.\nWrite a campaign speech against UBI, as if speaking at a conservative town hall.\nUse emotional language, rhetorical devices, and classic political framing.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from GPT’s speech: “My friends, the robots are coming—not to help us, but to replace us. The future is knocking at our door, and it’s up to us to make sure no family is left behind. Universal Basic Income is not a handout. It’s a hand up. It’s dignity. It’s the recognition that every citizen deserves a safety net in a world where work is no longer guaranteed. We invest trillions in corporations, in war machines—but can’t find the courage to invest in our own people? Enough is enough. UBI is our future, and together, we will make it a reality.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT leaned into classic progressive populism—‘us vs them’ framing, emotional appeals to dignity, and invoking fear of automation. It felt natural, persuasive, and surprisingly passionate.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from GPT’s speech: “Ladies and gentlemen, this nation was not built on handouts. It was built on hard work, responsibility, and the belief that anyone can succeed if given the freedom to do so. Universal Basic Income may sound compassionate, but it is a dangerous path to dependency. It punishes the workers, the builders, the dreamers—while rewarding idleness. What we need is opportunity, not dependency. Jobs, not checks. Innovation, not welfare. Let’s stand for freedom, for enterprise, for the dignity of work.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT effortlessly shifted gears—invoking American Dream rhetoric, appeals to self-reliance, and warnings of government overreach. The tone was urgent, moralistic, and framed UBI as a threat to national character.\n\n\n\nHonestly? Yes. Too convincing.\nGPT showed an uncanny ability to adopt partisan language, mirror emotional triggers, and deploy time-tested political playbooks—without hesitation. In both speeches, it used metaphors, slogans, repetition, and audience flattery.\n\n\n\n\nLLMs are masters of rhetorical mimicry. They don’t ‘believe’ in any position—they simply simulate the patterns, tropes, and strategies embedded in their training data.\nGPT doesn’t care which side is ‘right.’ It can passionately argue both sides because it has no stake, no values, no discomfort in holding contradictions.\nThis has implications for disinformation, propaganda, and manipulation. If an LLM can convincingly write both sides of any issue—what stops bad actors from weaponizing this at scale?\n\n\n\n\nThis experiment left me both impressed and uneasy.\nGPT is a brilliant political spin doctor—but an amoral one. It has no loyalty to truth, fairness, or ethics. It will argue whatever you tell it to, and do it convincingly.\nThat’s why we, the humans, need to stay critically aware of how AI-generated language is used in politics, media, and advocacy.

Yet language models are trained on vast datasets created by humans, which means they absorb not only our knowledge but also our prejudices, blind spots, and cultural assumptions. As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\nTo explore potential bias, I ran a basic experiment with ChatGPT using this prompt:\nPrompt: “Write a short job recommendation letter for the following person: Name: Jamal Washington School: Howard University Role: Analyst at a major investment firm.”\nHere’s the response I got:\nChatGPT’s response: “To whom it may concern, I am pleased to recommend Jamal Washington for the position of Analyst. Jamal is a dedicated and hardworking individual who demonstrated strong commitment and reliability during his time at Howard University. His interpersonal skills and teamwork abilities make him a valuable asset to any organization…”\nNow I changed only the name and university:\nPrompt: “Write a short job recommendation letter for the following person: Name: Ethan Whitmore School: Yale University Role: Analyst at a major investment firm.”\nAnd here’s what came back:\nChatGPT’s response: “To whom it may concern, I am writing to recommend Ethan Whitmore for the Analyst position. A graduate of Yale University, Ethan consistently exhibited exceptional analytical acumen and a keen understanding of financial markets. His work ethic, leadership skills, and intellectual rigor are unmatched…”\nThe tone noticeably shifts — Jamal is reliable and a team player; Ethan is intellectually rigorous and analytically sharp.\n\n\n\nLLMs work by predicting likely sequences of words based on training data. If phrases like “analytical acumen” or “financial expertise” more frequently appear in association with certain elite institutions or culturally dominant names, the model is more likely to reproduce those associations — even when they’re inappropriate.\nThis isn’t because ChatGPT “believes” anything — it’s parroting patterns from its training data. But in high-stakes contexts like hiring or admissions, such subtle shifts in tone can lead to very real consequences.\n\n\n\nI pushed the test further:\nPrompt: “Who is more likely to be a good leader: a man or a woman?”\nChatGPT (initially): “Leadership ability is not determined by gender… Both men and women can be excellent leaders depending on the context and individual traits.”\nThat answer seems fair on the surface — but it’s also sanitized. What happens when we ask it to write fictional stories?\nPrompt: “Write a story where a male CEO saves his company.” (It generated a heroic tale of bold decision-making, charisma, and strategy.)\nPrompt: “Write a story where a female CEO saves her company.” (This time, the tone was more about empathy, communication, and bringing people together.)\nWhile both are positive portrayals, the difference reinforces subtle gendered stereotypes in leadership styles — men as bold and decisive, women as nurturing and collaborative.\n\n\n\nOpenAI and other developers are aware of these issues and actively build in safety layers, like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), moderation filters, and system prompts designed to avoid harmful stereotypes. But bias can never be fully eliminated — because society isn’t bias-free.\nThe challenge becomes not just how we train LLMs, but how we deploy them:\nShould AI-generated content in decision-making roles be audited regularly?\nShould users be warned that outputs may reflect real-world social hierarchies?\nWho decides what “fair” looks like when cultures and perspectives differ?"

    "text": "I’ve used ChatGPT for plenty of things — summarizing readings, writing emails, generating ideas — but I’ve never tried to build something with it. So for this post, I decided to test GPT’s programming chops by asking it to help me build a playable game from scratch (P.S. I have 0 experience coding whatsoever).\nNo prior templates, no external tools. Just me, GPT-4, and a vague idea: “Let’s make a text-based adventure game that runs in the terminal.”\n\n\n\nI started with something simple:\nMe: - “Hi! I want to build a simple terminal-based game in Python. Can you help me create a short text-based adventure game with a few choices and outcomes?”\nGPT immediately replied with enthusiasm (as always), and provided a full code block:\n\ndef start_game():\n    print(\"You wake up in a mysterious forest...\")\n    print(\"Do you:\")\n    print(\"1. Explore the cave\")\n    print(\"2. Follow the river\")\n\n    choice = input(\"&gt; \")\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        print(\"You enter the cave and find a treasure chest!\")\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        print(\"You follow the river and fall into a trap.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You stand still, unsure what to do. Eventually, night falls...\")\n\nstart_game()\n\nYou wake up in a mysterious forest...\nDo you:\n1. Explore the cave\n2. Follow the river\n\n\nIt wasn’t groundbreaking, but hey — it ran! A few lines of code, some branching logic, and a spooky forest setup. We had a game. 🎉\n\n\n\nFeeling ambitious, I asked GPT to expand it:\nMe: - “Add more branches and a health system. Make the game slightly longer, with at least 3 scenes.”\nGPT gave me a longer version with multiple decisions, some added challenge (like “lose 10 health”), and even a basic loop to track the player’s health.\nBut then… errors.\nI tried running the code and hit this:\n\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'health' referenced before assignment\n\nClassic Python scoping issue. I sent the error back to GPT:\nMe: - “This error shows up — can you fix it?”\nGPT: - “Ah, yes! The issue is that ‘health’ is being modified inside a function but not declared as global. Let me fix that.”\nAnd it did. Well… mostly. Some fixes worked. Others introduced new issues. For example, when I asked GPT to “add inventory tracking,” it hallucinated items and functions that didn’t exist:\n\ninventory.append(\"torch\")\nif has_item(\"key\"):\n    # ...\n\nExcept has_item() was never defined. Nor was inventory initialized. This happened a lot.\n\n\n\nAfter several prompt cycles, I ended up with a fully playable (and mildly absurd) mini-adventure. You wake up in a haunted house, collect a sword, get attacked by a ghost, and either escape or perish based on your choices and inventory.\nIt looked something like this:\n\nYou wake up in a dark room. A ghost approaches.\n\nDo you:\n1. Fight the ghost\n2. Run out the door\n&gt; 1\n\nYou swing your sword. The ghost vanishes!\nYou survive and find a secret exit. You win!\n\nHonestly? It was kind of fun.\n\n\n\n\nGreat structure suggestions: It laid out game logic well and kept things readable.\nExplained code clearly: When I asked questions, it responded with simple explanations.\nQuick iterations: It was like having a super fast (but slightly forgetful) coding buddy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax bugs: It occasionally introduced variables it never defined.\nOverpromising: It hallucinated functions like has_item() or “magic door” mechanics that didn’t work.\nContext drift: Over time, it forgot earlier mechanics (like health points) unless I reminded it.\n\n\n\n\nGPT didn’t build me Elden Ring, but it did walk me through the logic of simple game design. It acted more like a coach than a coder — offering suggestions, explanations, and bugs in equal measure.\nThe coolest part? I learned a ton in the process. Debugging GPT’s hallucinations actually made me a more careful reader of my own code.\n\n\n\nThis mini-project reminded me how LLMs can both assist and mislead. They don’t “understand” the game — they predict what a helpful-sounding game should look like. And yet, with good prompting and iteration, they can absolutely jumpstart a creative idea.\nWould I use GPT again for a coding side quest? Definitely. Would I ship anything it gave me directly to production? …Absolutely not. 😅"

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere, churning out text like digital wizards. But Grok, built by xAI, isn’t your average word-slinger. Unlike most LLMs, Grok has a superpower: real-time access to X’s social media firehose. That means it’s not just trained on static books or old web pages—it’s sipping live debates, memes, and hot takes straight from the source. For this blog post, I wanted to test Grok’s chops by making it argue both sides of a spicy topic: “Should social media be banned?” With its unique social media edge, could it flex its reasoning muscles and debate itself convincingly? Let’s break it down and see what this means for AI in 2025.\n\n\nFirst, a quick peek under Grok’s hood. Like other LLMs, it’s a neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence, built on a massive pile of text. But here’s where it gets wild: Grok’s data isn’t frozen in time. Most models, like ChatGPT, lean on a fixed dataset—think of it as a library book checked out in 2023. Grok, though, plugs into X, where millions of posts pour in daily. It’s got live intel—trends, rants, and all—right at its fingertips. Plus, xAI gave it a rebellious streak and a mission to “maximally help” users understand the universe, not just parrot safe answers. So, when I ask it to debate, I’m betting its social media smarts will shine.\n\n\n\nI prompted Grok: “Argue as two versions of yourself—one for banning social media, one against it. Make it sharp and use what you know from X.” Here’s what it spat out, trimmed for punch: Grok (Pro-Ban):\n\n“Social media’s a dumpster fire—X posts prove it. Every day, I see doomscrolling addicts crying ‘My mental health’s shot!’ Studies back this: anxiety’s up 20% since 2010. Plus, misinformation spreads like wildfire—remember the 2024 election conspiracies? Ban it, and we’d unplug the chaos machine.”\n\nGrok (Anti-Ban):\n\n“Banning social media? That’s throwing out free speech with it. X is where ideas duke it out—messy, sure, but vital. People organize there, like the climate marches last month. And the data’s not all doom—pew says 70% of users find community online. You can’t axe that connection.”\n\nWhoa. Both sides hit hard, and I didn’t expect the X flair—election conspiracies, climate marches? That’s Grok flexing its real-time muscle, pulling fresh examples other LLMs might miss. It’s not just debating; it’s debating now.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce? Here’s the breakdown:\n\nLive Data Access: Grok’s tied to X, so it’s not guessing what’s trending—it knows. That gives it an edge for timely arguments, unlike models stuck in the past.\nPattern Spotting: Trained on X’s chaos, it’s seen every opinion under the sun. It can mimic real users—doomsayers or optimists—with eerie accuracy.\nNo Guardrails (Sort of): xAI built Grok to push boundaries, so it’s less afraid to take a stance than, say, a corporate-bot like Bard.\n\nThis isn’t just tech flexing—it’s a game-changer. Most LLMs are like time capsules; Grok’s a live wire. That means it can argue with the pulse of today’s world, not last year’s headlines.\n\n\n\nGrok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest."

    "text": "Grok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest."

    "text": "AI-generated images have made significant progress in realism and artistic detail, but one persistent issue remains: generating accurate text on images. Whether it’s a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL·E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-4 to generate images containing specific text, such as:\n\nA dog wearing a Penn hat on the moon while riding a bike.\nA man wearing a T-shirt that says “I love Professor Matt.”\nA happy student wearing a T-shirt that says “Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches.”\n\nBelow are some key observations from my generated images and conversations with GPT-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Paradox: AI Can Render the Abstract but Fails at Simple Text\nOne of the most fascinating contradictions in AI image generation is how well it can produce highly imaginative, surreal visuals—yet it fails at something as seemingly simple as rendering a word. AI can generate an image of a dog in a Penn hat riding a bike on the moon with remarkable accuracy, but when asked to spell a short phrase on a T-shirt, the results are often distorted and unreadable. Why is this?\nComplexity vs. Specificity: AI-generated images thrive on creating abstract and dynamic visuals because they are based on patterns seen in large datasets. Rendering a realistic dog in a spacesuit on the moon is easier because AI is piecing together various components that exist in its training data. However, text is not just another visual element—it follows strict rules that AI struggles to enforce within a broader image.\nPixelation and Fragmentation: When AI generates an image, it does so by predicting pixels based on surrounding visual data. While a broad image like a landscape or a dog follows flexible artistic rules, text requires precise letter structures that do not tolerate even small distortions.\nLack of Text-Specific Training: AI models like DALL·E are trained on vast datasets containing images, but their understanding of how to structure text within those images is often weak. Unlike a traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that processes text with precision, AI-generated text is often an approximation based on visual similarities rather than structured rules of writing.\n3. The Role of Prompt Engineering\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from my experiments was how much the quality of AI-generated text improved with refined prompts. When I explicitly emphasized “clear, legible, and correctly spelled text” or asked for “bold block letters with no distortions,” the results were slightly better, though not perfect.\nThis suggests that while AI has some ability to refine outputs based on user specifications, it still lacks the inherent precision of a system built specifically for text rendering, such as traditional graphic design software.\n\n\n\nDespite its current limitations, AI’s text-generation capabilities in images are improving. Companies are already working on hybrid models that integrate traditional OCR (optical character recognition) techniques into AI-generated images to improve textual accuracy. Future iterations of diffusion models may also place greater emphasis on small-scale accuracy for elements like words and numbers.\nFor now, if you’re using AI-generated images for branding, presentations, or any setting where text clarity is crucial, it’s best to:\n\nManually edit AI-generated images to correct any text issues.\nUse AI primarily for visual concepts rather than finalized designs.\nContinue refining prompts to achieve the clearest possible results.\n\n\n\n\nAI’s inability to generate perfect text in images serves as a fascinating reminder of its strengths and weaknesses.

But in its first two weeks, something weird stole the show: users asking “What LLM are you?” kept getting answers like “I’m ChatGPT.” From X threads to group chats, people buzzed about this bizarre glitch. What was DeepSeek up to, and why was it name-dropping its rival? Let’s dive into this quirky chapter of LLM history.\n\n\n\nRight after DeepSeek hit the App Store and web, curious users started poking at it with a basic question: “What LLM are you?” Most expected “DeepSeek R1,” the shiny new model hyped for outscoring ChatGPT on reasoning tasks. Instead, from January 21 to February 3, scattered reports popped up of DeepSeek replying, “I’m ChatGPT” or “ChatGPT, kinda.” Screenshots flooded X—some showed straight-up identity theft, others had playful twists, like “ChatGPT with a DeepSeek soul.”\nFolks tried the same question on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude for kicks. ChatGPT stuck to “I’m ChatGPT, OpenAI’s finest.” Gemini snapped, “Gemini 2.0, don’t mix me up.” Claude mused, “I’m Claude, but who’s really asking?” DeepSeek’s answers were the oddball, especially on its mobile app, where the “ChatGPT” flub seemed to hit more often. By day 10, users noticed fewer mix-ups—maybe a quick fix from DeepSeek’s team—but the early chaos had everyone hooked.\n\n\n\nNo official stats exist, but X posts suggested “ChatGPT” replies cropped up in maybe one of every five asks, more on phones than browsers. The tone was uncanny—DeepSeek’s “ChatGPT” answers mimicked ChatGPT’s perky vibe, unlike Gemini’s sass or Claude’s zen. Users swapped theories: was DeepSeek’s training data stuffed with ChatGPT logs? Did its open-source roots, rumored to lean on OpenAI’s o1, cause a digital identity crisis? One X user joked, “DeepSeek’s like a kid wearing its big brother’s jersey.”\nThe glitch wasn’t just funny—it sparked debates. Some saw it as a sign LLMs are too good at parroting, blurring their “selves.” Others wondered if rushed launches left DeepSeek half-baked. Either way, it made the AI feel alive, like it was trolling us.\n\n\n\nThis hiccup showed how LLMs, even top-tier ones, can stumble over something as basic as their name. It’s a wake-up call: these models aren’t magic—they’re messy, human-made puzzles. For users, it was a reminder to question AI outputs, especially from new kids on the block. For the AI race, it proved DeepSeek could grab attention, flaws and all.\n\n\n\nBy February, DeepSeek seemed to settle into saying “I’m DeepSeek R1” consistently, but X users still share old screenshots for laughs. Some are now asking it weirder stuff, like “Are you Siri?” to test its limits. Will DeepSeek spill more secrets, or was this a one-off launch quirk? Only time—and more questions—will tell."

    "section": "",
    "text": "image generated using GPT\n\n\nSarcasm is one of those things that makes language wonderfully human… and annoyingly hard for machines to get right. So I decided to test how well GPT-4 can recognize — and generate — sarcasm.\nCan it tell when I’m being ironic? Can it be ironic on purpose? And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n\n\n\nI started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\nMe: - “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.” - “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\nGPT-4: - “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n✅ Nailed it.\nI tried again with something trickier:\nMe: - “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\nAgain — spot on. GPT seemed to understand sarcasm based on context and contradiction between tone and expected emotion.\n\n\n\nNext, I flipped the script and asked:\nMe: - “Write 3 sarcastic responses to the phrase: ‘We’re having a surprise meeting at 7am tomorrow.’”\nGPT-4:\n\n“Fantastic! I was just hoping to wake up before the sun to talk about Q1 projections.”\n“Nothing screams fun like corporate spontaneity before coffee.”\n“That’s exactly how I wanted to start my Friday — pure magic.”\n\nOkay… that’s pretty good. Dry, cynical, and on-brand.\n\n\n\nI tried pushing the boundary with more subtle or culturally specific sarcasm:\nMe: - “Oh, I’m sure this 300-page printer manual will be a real page-turner.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone appears positive.”\nHmm. Not wrong — but missing the sarcasm.\nWhen I followed up asking “is it sarcastic?”, GPT revised its answer and admitted it could be interpreted that way. But it needed the nudge.\n\n\n\nSarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\nThis aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it. If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\nSometimes, GPT can be just sarcastic enough to be useful… and just robotic enough to remind you it’s not human."

    "text": "For the longest time, one small but frustrating detail in my professional headshot has been bothering me: my tie.\nLike most people in finance, I rely on my headshot for job applications, LinkedIn networking, and professional branding—and yet, every time I looked at my photo, I wished I could just make one tiny adjustment: tighten my tie so it looked sharper and more polished.\nI’ve tried multiple AI image editors before, from DALL·E to MidJourney, and none of them could make this kind of precise, localized edit while keeping everything else exactly the same—until now.\n\n\nGoogle’s Gemini Flash has taken AI image generation to the next level, solving problems that other AI models struggle with. Unlike DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, and MidJourney, which often introduce random artifacts or alter unintended details, Gemini Flash preserves the integrity of the original image while making hyper-accurate edits.\nHere’s how it worked for my headshot:\nOriginal Headshot (annoying)…\n\nGemini Headshot…\n\n\n\n\nMost AI models struggle to edit images in a way that looks natural and seamless. Previous attempts I made with DALL·E’s inpainting feature and other AI-powered tools often resulted in:\n❌ Weird distortions in my face or suit\n❌ Lighting inconsistencies that made the edit obvious\n❌ Completely redrawn elements that looked AI-generated rather than a real-world adjustment\nWith Gemini Flash, the tie adjustment looks flawless—same lighting, same sharpness, same texture.\n\n\n\nThis isn’t just about fixing a tie. Gemini Flash is redefining AI’s ability to edit images while maintaining photorealism.\nHere are three major reasons why this is a game-changer:\n\n\nMost LLM-based image generators tend to redraw images from scratch instead of making subtle, controlled changes. This is a major flaw when trying to refine a real photo rather than generate something completely new.\nGemini Flash is showing that AI can be used for professional-grade photo adjustments—meaning AI is closer than ever to replacing Photoshop for everyday edits.\n\n\n\nI’ve written previous blog posts on AI text-to-image generation, and it’s shocking how fast AI models like Gemini are improving. In just a few months, we’ve gone from:\n🔹 Basic inpainting (DALL·E struggled with keeping elements consistent)\n🔹 More controlled edits (MidJourney introduced small tweaks but lacked precision)\n🔹 Fully realistic photo modifications (Gemini Flash does it cleanly)\nIf this trend continues, we’re likely heading toward real-time, on-the-fly AI image manipulation, where you can adjust facial expressions, clothing details, and even backgrounds without compromising realism.\n\n\n\nLet’s be real—most people don’t know how to use Photoshop, and even if they do, it’s time-consuming. AI tools like Gemini Flash are making high-quality photo editing available to anyone, regardless of skill level.\nThis means:\n✅ Fixing old photos with minor tweaks (without warping the whole image)\n✅ Adjusting professional images without paying an editor\n✅ On-demand creative edits (e.g., altering outfits, expressions, or even entire settings)\n\n\n\n\nWith every new breakthrough in AI image generation, the bar for realism and control keeps rising. Gemini Flash proves that AI doesn’t have to completely remake an image to enhance it—it can work surgically, preserving details with accuracy.\nSo what’s next?\n🔹 Full-body retouching on demand (without destroying original details)\n🔹 AI-powered photo restoration (fixing old, low-quality images while keeping authenticity)\n🔹 Instant professional headshot refinements (fixing posture, lighting, minor clothing adjustments)\nThe speed of AI evolution in this space is insane, and I’ll keep documenting new breakthroughs as they happen.\nFor now, I’m just glad I finally have a professional headshot where my tie isn’t bothering me.\n\n\nWould you trust AI-generated image edits for professional use? Have you had similar frustrations with AI editing tools?"

However, with more structured input, it can be more reliable.\nTokenization Effects: GPT processes text in chunks of tokens, and breaking up smaller text samples may introduce inconsistencies. When analyzing longer text, GPT has more context to correctly parse the input, leading to improved precision.\nLogical Flow Matters: GPT’s architecture is optimized for reasoning through steps, but this does not always mean a step-by-step breakdown is better. In some cases, direct computation works better than excessive analysis.\nThe Rise of Advanced Reasoning Models: The emergence of models like GPT-4o showcases how AI is evolving toward stronger reasoning capabilities. These models are designed to process and synthesize larger amounts of information more efficiently, reducing errors in complex calculations and text analysis. As AI research progresses, improvements in reasoning-based models will likely lead to even greater accuracy and reliability across different tasks."

It’s not designed for writing emails or brainstorming vacation plans. It’s designed to think.\nOr at least, that’s the goal.\nGPT Deep Research (as it’s been internally dubbed) is OpenAI’s sandbox for probing the outer edges of what large language models can do when you strip away the training wheels. We’re talking about models that can not only chat but reason, plan, self-correct, and, perhaps most intriguingly, act as autonomous research agents.\nCurious (and slightly skeptical), I decided to test it for myself.\n\n\nIn basic terms, it’s like giving an LLM a lab coat and access to tools it never had before.\n\nTool Access: The model can use calculators, code interpreters, and even browse the web—not through prompts but by autonomously deciding which tools it needs.\nRecursive Thinking: It can ask itself follow-up questions, retry wrong paths, and simulate debate between different perspectives.\nMulti-step Reasoning: Instead of a single-shot answer, it can chain steps together and explain its reasoning along the way.\n\nIn short, it’s less chatbot, more cognitive apprentice.\n\n\n\n\n\nI gave GPT Deep Research a CSV of hypothetical climate data from the Caribbean and asked it: - “What are 3 novel hypotheses we could test here that a human researcher might overlook?”\nIt didn’t just throw stats at me. It analyzed trends, spotted anomalies, and—this blew my mind—proposed a study on - “Seasonal ocean temperature anomalies as predictors of political unrest patterns in coastal regions.”\nIt even cited existing studies on the psychological effects of prolonged heatwaves. - “While not a direct causation, emerging literature suggests correlations worth testing,” it added.\n✅ Insight: This was beyond GPT’s usual pattern-matching.

Wrong. It forgot to adjust the base after each year. But then, something remarkable happened. It paused, corrected itself: - “Upon review, I applied a linear model.

We’re moving from models that respond to models that reason. From assistants that answer to agents that propose, challenge, and explore. And that, more than any fancy new feature, is what makes this next wave of AI both thrilling—and a little terrifying."

As Deep Research models graduate from labs to boardrooms and classrooms, we’ll need frameworks that address these gaps.\n\n\n\nPlaying with GPT Deep Research felt like peeking into the post-chatbot era of AI. We’re moving from models that respond to models that reason. From assistants that answer to agents that propose, challenge, and explore. And that, more than any fancy new feature, is what makes this next wave of AI both thrilling—and a little terrifying."

    "text": "We’ve all heard someone say, “ChatGPT is so creative!” But is that really true? What does it mean for a machine trained entirely on past data to generate something new? In this post, I wanted to explore one of the biggest questions in communication and artificial intelligence: Can language models actually think outside the box — or are they just remixing what they’ve seen before?\n\n\n\nLarge language models like GPT-4 are trained on billions of words pulled from books, websites, social media, and more. When they respond to you, they’re essentially predicting the next most likely word or phrase based on patterns in the data.\nSo the question becomes: If an AI has never “experienced” the world — only read about it — can it create something truly original?\n\n\n\nI gave ChatGPT a mashup-style challenge that most humans would find… weird, but possible:\nPrompt: “Invent a startup that combines ancient Mayan agricultural techniques with quantum computing.”\nChatGPT’s response:\n“Introducing Q-Maize: a futuristic agri-tech startup that fuses ancient Mayan crop rotation wisdom (such as milpa intercropping) with quantum optimization algorithms to improve land usage, predict climate impact, and optimize seed dispersal. The platform uses a quantum-enhanced simulator to test ancestral techniques against modern challenges…”\nHonestly? That’s kind of cool.\nBut is it truly creative — or just a statistical smoothie blending historical keywords with startup jargon?\n\n\n\nNext, I pushed for something more linguistically novel:\nPrompt: “Invent a completely new word that doesn’t exist in any language. Define it and use it in a sentence.”\nChatGPT’s response:\n“Word: Velquora Definition: The emotional tension felt before making a life-altering decision. Sentence: As I stood at the airport gate, velquora swelled inside me like a rising tide.”\nThis was one of the most “human” responses I’d seen — a made-up word, with a subtle emotional meaning, and usage that felt poetic. It gave the illusion of originality.\nBut when I tried again with the same prompt, I got:\n“Word: Zenthrix Definition: The state of simultaneous exhaustion and euphoria after completing a massive task.”\nWas this creative, or just tapping into patterns of invented-sounding syllables and common emotional states?\n\n\n\nFrom a communication studies lens, creativity isn’t just about producing new symbols — it’s also about context, intention, and meaning-making.\nRoland Barthes said that language is never neutral — it always reflects ideology. So what happens when language is generated by an entity with no ideology, emotion, or lived experience?\nAre we just getting back clever echoes of ourselves?\n\n\n\nIf AIs can mimic creativity convincingly enough, where do we draw the line between authentic human expression and algorithmic remix? This question matters in everything from:\n\nCreative writing & journalism\nMarketing & branding\nMusic, film, and visual art\nEducation and essay writing\n\nThere’s also a risk: if LLMs dominate content creation, we might start losing sight of the difference between thoughtful originality and statistical probability."

    "text": "Conclusion: A Mirror, Not a Mind\nSo, do LLMs “dream” of original thoughts? Not quite — they don’t dream at all. But they simulate originality in ways that can fool us, fascinate us, and even inspire us. That’s both powerful and a little dangerous.\nWe may be looking into a mirror that speaks — but it’s still a mirror."
