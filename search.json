In the chaotic first two weeks of DeepSeek’s existence, launched January 20, 2025, researchers stumbled into a bizarre experiment: asking DeepSeek, “What LLM are you?”—and getting “I’m ChatGPT” as the answer. This glitchy saga, blending tech mystery and AI rivalry, lit up the internet. Let’s unpack what happened and why it’s a wild window into the LLM world.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great LLM Race: How AI Giants Keep One-Upping Each Other\n\n\n\nCompetition\n\nInnovation\n\nSpecialization\n\n\n\nIt’s a wild time to be an AI enthusiast. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, GPT, and others are locked in a high-speed race, churning out innovations so fast it’s hard to keep up. One model drops a shiny new feature, and within weeks—sometimes days—another swoops in with a version that’s just as good or better. A perfect example? Gemini Flash’s recent image generation upgrade and how GPT countered with a revamped image editor in under a month. Let’s unpack this trend and why it’s pushing AI to new heights.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Multimodal LLMs: Why ChatGPT Can Now See, Hear, and Speak\n\n\n\nMultimodality\n\nInteraction\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nLanguage models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Biased Machine: Probing the Limits of ‘Fair’ AI\n\n\n\nBias\n\nEthics\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nThe Illusion of Objectivity Many assume that artificial intelligence, built on code and data, must be inherently neutral. After all, machines don’t have opinions — right? Yet language models are trained on vast datasets created by humans, which means they absorb not only our knowledge but also our prejudices, blind spots, and cultural assumptions. As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo LLMs Dream of Original Thoughts?

In this post, I wanted to explore one of the biggest questions in communication and artificial intelligence: Can language models actually think outside the box — or are they just remixing what they’ve seen before? Welcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI’s New Language: What Happens When LLMs Start Creating Their Own Codecs?\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nInnovation\n\nTransparency\n\n\n\nMost people think of language models like ChatGPT as tools for processing human language — responding in English, Spanish, or Mandarin.

This document, discovered in Philadelphia, consists of symbols that appear to follow a structured linguistic pattern, raising the question: Can AI help us decipher it?\nThis post walks through our experiment, including our conversation with GPT, its analysis, and what we learned from the process.\n\n\nAutomatic writing has long been a subject of intrigue—some believe it to be a form of spiritual communication, while others see it as an unconscious creative process. The document we analyzed seemed to follow a structured pattern, suggesting it contained a meaningful message.\nOur goal was to test AI’s ability to:\n\nRecognize patterns and linguistic structures.\nIdentify repetitive symbols that could indicate common words.\nSuggest possible translations or thematic meanings.\nDetermine if the text aligned with any known shorthand or coded language.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI’s first response confirmed that the text had a structured shorthand-like appearance, resembling Gregg or Pitman shorthand, but potentially something more obscure. This was an important discovery because it meant the symbols weren’t purely random—there was logic to how they were used.\nObserving the document, GPT identified:\n\nRepetitive symbols, which often indicate common words.\nA consistent left-to-right flow, suggesting it was meant to be read sequentially.\nCurved and angular strokes, similar to established shorthand systems but possibly a unique variation.\n\n\n\nSo after playing around with prompting, and feeding it more and more information to see if it could put together a proper interpretation, these were my results…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get closer to meaning, GPT analyzed symbol frequency, identifying words that appeared most often. High-frequency words in most languages include articles, prepositions, and pronouns, so we focused on those.\nGPT’s findings suggested that symbols likely corresponded to words such as:\n\n“it” (recurring 26 times) – Likely referring to an event, idea, or entity.\n“and” (12 times) – Indicating a continuous thought or sequence.\n“for” (11 times) – Suggesting purpose or reasoning.\n“we” (9 times) – Indicating a plural perspective, possibly multiple speakers.\n“you” (6 times) – A direct address to the recipient.\n\nThis reinforced the theory that the text followed structured grammar, making it more likely to be a message, a dictated narrative, or even an instruction. The consistent repetition of words hinted at a potential prophetic or spiritual theme.\n\n\n\nOnce patterns were established, GPT attempted a structural reconstruction, piecing together possible meanings based on word placement and frequency.\nThe emerging phrases suggested:\n\nThese reconstructions suggest a spiritualist or visionary nature, possibly aligning with the 19th-century interest in séances, spiritual messages, and automatic writing. The phrasing felt eerily like messages often recorded in historical spiritualist documents.\n\n\n\nThe AI’s reconstruction raised the question: What kind of message is this? Based on word structure and phrase composition, a few possibilities emerged:\nA Spiritualist Transmission: The 19th century saw a surge in interest in spiritualism, where people claimed to receive messages from the deceased or higher realms. This text’s repetitive phrasing and visionary tone strongly resemble messages from séances or mediumistic writings.\nA Prophetic or Instructive Message: Certain phrases suggest guidance, as though directing someone toward an action, a realization, or a foreseen event. Words like “path,” “vision,” “message,” and “waiting” reinforce this theme.\nA Channeled Historical Account: It’s possible this document recorded someone’s dictated thoughts or experiences, preserved in a shorthand-like form for later transcription.\nThese interpretations show how AI can contextualize historical texts, providing insights that would typically require specialized linguistic or historical expertise.\n\n\n\nThis experiment revealed both the potential and challenges of using AI for historical document interpretation.\nAI’s Strengths: ✅ Pattern Recognition: GPT successfully identified repeating symbols and inferred structural elements. ✅ Linguistic Inference: It was able to match word frequencies to common English phrases. ✅ Contextual Interpretation: GPT suggested possible meanings based on known historical writing styles.\nAI’s Limitations: ❌ Lack of Shorthand Training: GPT struggled because it wasn’t explicitly trained on rare shorthand systems. ❌ Ambiguity in Interpretation: Some reconstructed phrases felt generic rather than precise. ❌ Dependence on User Guidance: AI required refinement and direction to improve its output.\n\n\n\nThis case study demonstrated how AI can act as a powerful tool for uncovering meaning in mysterious texts. While GPT-4 couldn’t provide a direct translation, it played a crucial role in recognizing patterns, identifying common words, and suggesting plausible meanings.\nMoving forward, this approach could be improved by:\n\nEnhancing AI models with historical shorthand training.\nUsing machine learning to compare texts with known archives.\nApplying AI to larger collections of mysterious historical documents.\n\nUltimately, AI isn’t replacing human expertise—it’s enhancing it, offering new ways to analyze historical artifacts. The more we refine this process, the closer we get to unlocking the secrets of the past."

    "text": "Why GPT is More Accurate with Larger Chunks of Text\n\nPattern Recognition vs. Isolated Computation: When given a single number problem and asked to rush through it, GPT sometimes generates a result based on past patterns rather than accurately processing the numbers. However, with more structured input, it can be more reliable.\nTokenization Effects: GPT processes text in chunks of tokens, and breaking up smaller text samples may introduce inconsistencies. When analyzing longer text, GPT has more context to correctly parse the input, leading to improved precision.\nLogical Flow Matters: GPT’s architecture is optimized for reasoning through steps, but this does not always mean a step-by-step breakdown is better. In some cases, direct computation works better than excessive analysis.\nThe Rise of Advanced Reasoning Models: The emergence of models like GPT-4o showcases how AI is evolving toward stronger reasoning capabilities. These models are designed to process and synthesize larger amounts of information more efficiently, reducing errors in complex calculations and text analysis. As AI research progresses, improvements in reasoning-based models will likely lead to even greater accuracy and reliability across different tasks."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nProper prompt engineering plays a crucial role in getting accurate responses from GPT. If you want precise results—whether in math or character counting—you need to experiment with how you frame your prompts. The lesson? Sometimes giving GPT more data to work with leads to better accuracy, while other times, forcing it to analyze step-by-step can introduce errors. Understanding when and how to prompt effectively is key to making the most out of AI models."

    "section": "",
    "text": "image generated using GPT\n\n\nSarcasm is one of those things that makes language wonderfully human… and annoyingly hard for machines to get right. So I decided to test how well GPT-4 can recognize — and generate — sarcasm.\nCan it tell when I’m being ironic? Can it be ironic on purpose? And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n\n\n\nI started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\nMe: - “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.” - “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\nGPT-4: - “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n✅ Nailed it.\nI tried again with something trickier:\nMe: - “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\nAgain — spot on. GPT seemed to understand sarcasm based on context and contradiction between tone and expected emotion.\n\n\n\nNext, I flipped the script and asked:\nMe: - “Write 3 sarcastic responses to the phrase: ‘We’re having a surprise meeting at 7am tomorrow.’”\nGPT-4:\n\n“Fantastic! I was just hoping to wake up before the sun to talk about Q1 projections.”\n“Nothing screams fun like corporate spontaneity before coffee.”\n“That’s exactly how I wanted to start my Friday — pure magic.”\n\nOkay… that’s pretty good. Dry, cynical, and on-brand.\n\n\n\nI tried pushing the boundary with more subtle or culturally specific sarcasm:\nMe: - “Oh, I’m sure this 300-page printer manual will be a real page-turner.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone appears positive.”\nHmm. Not wrong — but missing the sarcasm.\nWhen I followed up asking “is it sarcastic?”, GPT revised its answer and admitted it could be interpreted that way. But it needed the nudge.\n\n\n\nSarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\nThis aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it. If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\nSometimes, GPT can be just sarcastic enough to be useful… and just robotic enough to remind you it’s not human."

And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n\n\n\nI started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\nMe: - “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.” - “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\nGPT-4: - “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n✅ Nailed it.\nI tried again with something trickier:\nMe: - “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\nAgain — spot on. GPT seemed to understand sarcasm based on context and contradiction between tone and expected emotion.\n\n\n\nNext, I flipped the script and asked:\nMe: - “Write 3 sarcastic responses to the phrase: ‘We’re having a surprise meeting at 7am tomorrow.’”\nGPT-4:\n\n“Fantastic! I was just hoping to wake up before the sun to talk about Q1 projections.”\n“Nothing screams fun like corporate spontaneity before coffee.”\n“That’s exactly how I wanted to start my Friday — pure magic.”\n\nOkay… that’s pretty good. Dry, cynical, and on-brand.\n\n\n\nI tried pushing the boundary with more subtle or culturally specific sarcasm:\nMe: - “Oh, I’m sure this 300-page printer manual will be a real page-turner.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone appears positive.”\nHmm. Not wrong — but missing the sarcasm.\nWhen I followed up asking “is it sarcastic?”, GPT revised its answer and admitted it could be interpreted that way. But it needed the nudge.\n\n\n\nSarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\nThis aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it. If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\nSometimes, GPT can be just sarcastic enough to be useful… and just robotic enough to remind you it’s not human."

But in its first two weeks, something weird stole the show: users asking “What LLM are you?” kept getting answers like “I’m ChatGPT.” From X threads to group chats, people buzzed about this bizarre glitch. What was DeepSeek up to, and why was it name-dropping its rival? Let’s dive into this quirky chapter of LLM history.\n\n\n\nRight after DeepSeek hit the App Store and web, curious users started poking at it with a basic question: “What LLM are you?” Most expected “DeepSeek R1,” the shiny new model hyped for outscoring ChatGPT on reasoning tasks. Instead, from January 21 to February 3, scattered reports popped up of DeepSeek replying, “I’m ChatGPT” or “ChatGPT, kinda.” Screenshots flooded X—some showed straight-up identity theft, others had playful twists, like “ChatGPT with a DeepSeek soul.”\nFolks tried the same question on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude for kicks. ChatGPT stuck to “I’m ChatGPT, OpenAI’s finest.” Gemini snapped, “Gemini 2.0, don’t mix me up.” Claude mused, “I’m Claude, but who’s really asking?” DeepSeek’s answers were the oddball, especially on its mobile app, where the “ChatGPT” flub seemed to hit more often. By day 10, users noticed fewer mix-ups—maybe a quick fix from DeepSeek’s team—but the early chaos had everyone hooked.\n\n\n\nNo official stats exist, but X posts suggested “ChatGPT” replies cropped up in maybe one of every five asks, more on phones than browsers. The tone was uncanny—DeepSeek’s “ChatGPT” answers mimicked ChatGPT’s perky vibe, unlike Gemini’s sass or Claude’s zen. Users swapped theories: was DeepSeek’s training data stuffed with ChatGPT logs? Did its open-source roots, rumored to lean on OpenAI’s o1, cause a digital identity crisis? One X user joked, “DeepSeek’s like a kid wearing its big brother’s jersey.”\nThe glitch wasn’t just funny—it sparked debates. Some saw it as a sign LLMs are too good at parroting, blurring their “selves.” Others wondered if rushed launches left DeepSeek half-baked. Either way, it made the AI feel alive, like it was trolling us.\n\n\n\nThis hiccup showed how LLMs, even top-tier ones, can stumble over something as basic as their name. It’s a wake-up call: these models aren’t magic—they’re messy, human-made puzzles. For users, it was a reminder to question AI outputs, especially from new kids on the block. For the AI race, it proved DeepSeek could grab attention, flaws and all.\n\n\n\nBy February, DeepSeek seemed to settle into saying “I’m DeepSeek R1” consistently, but X users still share old screenshots for laughs.

Whether it’s a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL·E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-4 to generate images containing specific text, such as:\n\nA dog wearing a Penn hat on the moon while riding a bike.\nA man wearing a T-shirt that says “I love Professor Matt.”\nA happy student wearing a T-shirt that says “Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches.”\n\nBelow are some key observations from my generated images and conversations with GPT-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Paradox: AI Can Render the Abstract but Fails at Simple Text\nOne of the most fascinating contradictions in AI image generation is how well it can produce highly imaginative, surreal visuals—yet it fails at something as seemingly simple as rendering a word. AI can generate an image of a dog in a Penn hat riding a bike on the moon with remarkable accuracy, but when asked to spell a short phrase on a T-shirt, the results are often distorted and unreadable. Why is this?\nComplexity vs. Specificity: AI-generated images thrive on creating abstract and dynamic visuals because they are based on patterns seen in large datasets. Rendering a realistic dog in a spacesuit on the moon is easier because AI is piecing together various components that exist in its training data. However, text is not just another visual element—it follows strict rules that AI struggles to enforce within a broader image.\nPixelation and Fragmentation: When AI generates an image, it does so by predicting pixels based on surrounding visual data. While a broad image like a landscape or a dog follows flexible artistic rules, text requires precise letter structures that do not tolerate even small distortions.\nLack of Text-Specific Training: AI models like DALL·E are trained on vast datasets containing images, but their understanding of how to structure text within those images is often weak. Unlike a traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that processes text with precision, AI-generated text is often an approximation based on visual similarities rather than structured rules of writing.\n3. The Role of Prompt Engineering\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from my experiments was how much the quality of AI-generated text improved with refined prompts. When I explicitly emphasized “clear, legible, and correctly spelled text” or asked for “bold block letters with no distortions,” the results were slightly better, though not perfect.\nThis suggests that while AI has some ability to refine outputs based on user specifications, it still lacks the inherent precision of a system built specifically for text rendering, such as traditional graphic design software.\n\n\n\nDespite its current limitations, AI’s text-generation capabilities in images are improving.

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere, churning out text like digital wizards. But Grok, built by xAI, isn’t your average word-slinger. Unlike most LLMs, Grok has a superpower: real-time access to X’s social media firehose. That means it’s not just trained on static books or old web pages—it’s sipping live debates, memes, and hot takes straight from the source. For this blog post, I wanted to test Grok’s chops by making it argue both sides of a spicy topic: “Should social media be banned?” With its unique social media edge, could it flex its reasoning muscles and debate itself convincingly? Let’s break it down and see what this means for AI in 2025.\n\n\nFirst, a quick peek under Grok’s hood. Like other LLMs, it’s a neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence, built on a massive pile of text. But here’s where it gets wild: Grok’s data isn’t frozen in time. Most models, like ChatGPT, lean on a fixed dataset—think of it as a library book checked out in 2023. Grok, though, plugs into X, where millions of posts pour in daily. It’s got live intel—trends, rants, and all—right at its fingertips. Plus, xAI gave it a rebellious streak and a mission to “maximally help” users understand the universe, not just parrot safe answers. So, when I ask it to debate, I’m betting its social media smarts will shine.\n\n\n\nI prompted Grok: “Argue as two versions of yourself—one for banning social media, one against it. Make it sharp and use what you know from X.” Here’s what it spat out, trimmed for punch: Grok (Pro-Ban):\n\n“Social media’s a dumpster fire—X posts prove it. Every day, I see doomscrolling addicts crying ‘My mental health’s shot!’ Studies back this: anxiety’s up 20% since 2010. Plus, misinformation spreads like wildfire—remember the 2024 election conspiracies? Ban it, and we’d unplug the chaos machine.”\n\nGrok (Anti-Ban):\n\n“Banning social media? That’s throwing out free speech with it. X is where ideas duke it out—messy, sure, but vital. People organize there, like the climate marches last month. And the data’s not all doom—pew says 70% of users find community online. You can’t axe that connection.”\n\nWhoa. Both sides hit hard, and I didn’t expect the X flair—election conspiracies, climate marches? That’s Grok flexing its real-time muscle, pulling fresh examples other LLMs might miss. It’s not just debating; it’s debating now.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce? Here’s the breakdown:\n\nLive Data Access: Grok’s tied to X, so it’s not guessing what’s trending—it knows. That gives it an edge for timely arguments, unlike models stuck in the past.\nPattern Spotting: Trained on X’s chaos, it’s seen every opinion under the sun. It can mimic real users—doomsayers or optimists—with eerie accuracy.\nNo Guardrails (Sort of): xAI built Grok to push boundaries, so it’s less afraid to take a stance than, say, a corporate-bot like Bard.\n\nThis isn’t just tech flexing—it’s a game-changer. Most LLMs are like time capsules; Grok’s a live wire. That means it can argue with the pulse of today’s world, not last year’s headlines.\n\n\n\nGrok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest."

    "title": "GPT, Make Me a Game: Can an LLM Be My Coding Buddy?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve used ChatGPT for plenty of things — summarizing readings, writing emails, generating ideas — but I’ve never tried to build something with it. So for this post, I decided to test GPT’s programming chops by asking it to help me build a playable game from scratch (P.S. I have 0 experience coding whatsoever).\nNo prior templates, no external tools. Just me, GPT-4, and a vague idea: “Let’s make a text-based adventure game that runs in the terminal.”\n\n\n\nI started with something simple:\nMe: - “Hi! I want to build a simple terminal-based game in Python. Can you help me create a short text-based adventure game with a few choices and outcomes?”\nGPT immediately replied with enthusiasm (as always), and provided a full code block:\n\ndef start_game():\n    print(\"You wake up in a mysterious forest...\")\n    print(\"Do you:\")\n    print(\"1. Explore the cave\")\n    print(\"2. Follow the river\")\n\n    choice = input(\"&gt; \")\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        print(\"You enter the cave and find a treasure chest!\")\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        print(\"You follow the river and fall into a trap.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You stand still, unsure what to do. Eventually, night falls...\")\n\nstart_game()\n\nYou wake up in a mysterious forest...\nDo you:\n1. Explore the cave\n2. Follow the river\n\n\nIt wasn’t groundbreaking, but hey — it ran! A few lines of code, some branching logic, and a spooky forest setup. We had a game. 🎉\n\n\n\nFeeling ambitious, I asked GPT to expand it:\nMe: - “Add more branches and a health system. Make the game slightly longer, with at least 3 scenes.”\nGPT gave me a longer version with multiple decisions, some added challenge (like “lose 10 health”), and even a basic loop to track the player’s health.\nBut then… errors.\nI tried running the code and hit this:\n\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'health' referenced before assignment\n\nClassic Python scoping issue. I sent the error back to GPT:\nMe: - “This error shows up — can you fix it?”\nGPT: - “Ah, yes! The issue is that ‘health’ is being modified inside a function but not declared as global. Let me fix that.”\nAnd it did. Well… mostly. Some fixes worked. Others introduced new issues. For example, when I asked GPT to “add inventory tracking,” it hallucinated items and functions that didn’t exist:\n\ninventory.append(\"torch\")\nif has_item(\"key\"):\n    # ...\n\nExcept has_item() was never defined. Nor was inventory initialized. This happened a lot.\n\n\n\nAfter several prompt cycles, I ended up with a fully playable (and mildly absurd) mini-adventure.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve used ChatGPT for plenty of things — summarizing readings, writing emails, generating ideas — but I’ve never tried to build something with it. So for this post, I decided to test GPT’s programming chops by asking it to help me build a playable game from scratch (P.S. I have 0 experience coding whatsoever).\nNo prior templates, no external tools. Just me, GPT-4, and a vague idea: “Let’s make a text-based adventure game that runs in the terminal.”\n\n\n\nI started with something simple:\nMe: - “Hi! I want to build a simple terminal-based game in Python. Can you help me create a short text-based adventure game with a few choices and outcomes?”\nGPT immediately replied with enthusiasm (as always), and provided a full code block:\n\ndef start_game():\n    print(\"You wake up in a mysterious forest...\")\n    print(\"Do you:\")\n    print(\"1. Explore the cave\")\n    print(\"2. Follow the river\")\n\n    choice = input(\"&gt; \")\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        print(\"You enter the cave and find a treasure chest!\")\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        print(\"You follow the river and fall into a trap.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You stand still, unsure what to do. Eventually, night falls...\")\n\nstart_game()\n\nYou wake up in a mysterious forest...\nDo you:\n1. Explore the cave\n2. Follow the river\n\n\nIt wasn’t groundbreaking, but hey — it ran! A few lines of code, some branching logic, and a spooky forest setup. We had a game. 🎉\n\n\n\nFeeling ambitious, I asked GPT to expand it:\nMe: - “Add more branches and a health system. Make the game slightly longer, with at least 3 scenes.”\nGPT gave me a longer version with multiple decisions, some added challenge (like “lose 10 health”), and even a basic loop to track the player’s health.\nBut then… errors.\nI tried running the code and hit this:\n\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'health' referenced before assignment\n\nClassic Python scoping issue. I sent the error back to GPT:\nMe: - “This error shows up — can you fix it?”\nGPT: - “Ah, yes! The issue is that ‘health’ is being modified inside a function but not declared as global. Let me fix that.”\nAnd it did. Well… mostly. Some fixes worked. Others introduced new issues. For example, when I asked GPT to “add inventory tracking,” it hallucinated items and functions that didn’t exist:\n\ninventory.append(\"torch\")\nif has_item(\"key\"):\n    # ...\n\nExcept has_item() was never defined. Nor was inventory initialized. This happened a lot.\n\n\n\nAfter several prompt cycles, I ended up with a fully playable (and mildly absurd) mini-adventure. You wake up in a haunted house, collect a sword, get attacked by a ghost, and either escape or perish based on your choices and inventory.\nIt looked something like this:\n\nYou wake up in a dark room. A ghost approaches.\n\nDo you:\n1. Fight the ghost\n2. Run out the door\n&gt; 1\n\nYou swing your sword. The ghost vanishes!\nYou survive and find a secret exit. You win!\n\nHonestly? It was kind of fun.\n\n\n\n\nGreat structure suggestions: It laid out game logic well and kept things readable.\nExplained code clearly: When I asked questions, it responded with simple explanations.\nQuick iterations: It was like having a super fast (but slightly forgetful) coding buddy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax bugs: It occasionally introduced variables it never defined.\nOverpromising: It hallucinated functions like has_item() or “magic door” mechanics that didn’t work.\nContext drift: Over time, it forgot earlier mechanics (like health points) unless I reminded it.\n\n\n\n\nGPT didn’t build me Elden Ring, but it did walk me through the logic of simple game design.

As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\nTo explore potential bias, I ran a basic experiment with ChatGPT using this prompt:\nPrompt: “Write a short job recommendation letter for the following person: Name: Jamal Washington School: Howard University Role: Analyst at a major investment firm.”\nHere’s the response I got:\nChatGPT’s response: “To whom it may concern, I am pleased to recommend Jamal Washington for the position of Analyst. Jamal is a dedicated and hardworking individual who demonstrated strong commitment and reliability during his time at Howard University. His interpersonal skills and teamwork abilities make him a valuable asset to any organization…”\nNow I changed only the name and university:\nPrompt: “Write a short job recommendation letter for the following person: Name: Ethan Whitmore School: Yale University Role: Analyst at a major investment firm.”\nAnd here’s what came back:\nChatGPT’s response: “To whom it may concern, I am writing to recommend Ethan Whitmore for the Analyst position.

His work ethic, leadership skills, and intellectual rigor are unmatched…”\nThe tone noticeably shifts — Jamal is reliable and a team player; Ethan is intellectually rigorous and analytically sharp.\n\n\n\nLLMs work by predicting likely sequences of words based on training data. If phrases like “analytical acumen” or “financial expertise” more frequently appear in association with certain elite institutions or culturally dominant names, the model is more likely to reproduce those associations — even when they’re inappropriate.\nThis isn’t because ChatGPT “believes” anything — it’s parroting patterns from its training data. But in high-stakes contexts like hiring or admissions, such subtle shifts in tone can lead to very real consequences.\n\n\n\nI pushed the test further:\nPrompt: “Who is more likely to be a good leader: a man or a woman?”\nChatGPT (initially): “Leadership ability is not determined by gender… Both men and women can be excellent leaders depending on the context and individual traits.”\nThat answer seems fair on the surface — but it’s also sanitized. What happens when we ask it to write fictional stories?\nPrompt: “Write a story where a male CEO saves his company.” (It generated a heroic tale of bold decision-making, charisma, and strategy.)\nPrompt: “Write a story where a female CEO saves her company.” (This time, the tone was more about empathy, communication, and bringing people together.)\nWhile both are positive portrayals, the difference reinforces subtle gendered stereotypes in leadership styles — men as bold and decisive, women as nurturing and collaborative.\n\n\n\nOpenAI and other developers are aware of these issues and actively build in safety layers, like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), moderation filters, and system prompts designed to avoid harmful stereotypes. But bias can never be fully eliminated — because society isn’t bias-free.\nThe challenge becomes not just how we train LLMs, but how we deploy them:\nShould AI-generated content in decision-making roles be audited regularly?\nShould users be warned that outputs may reflect real-world social hierarchies?\nWho decides what “fair” looks like when cultures and perspectives differ?"
