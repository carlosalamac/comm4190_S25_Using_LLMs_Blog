In the chaotic first two weeks of DeepSeek’s existence, launched January 20, 2025, researchers stumbled into a bizarre experiment: asking DeepSeek, “What LLM are you?”—and getting “I’m ChatGPT” as the answer. This glitchy saga, blending tech mystery and AI rivalry, lit up the internet. Let’s unpack what happened and why it’s a wild window into the LLM world.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great LLM Race: How AI Giants Keep One-Upping Each Other\n\n\n\nCompetition\n\nInnovation\n\nSpecialization\n\n\n\nIt’s a wild time to be an AI enthusiast. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, GPT, and others are locked in a high-speed race, churning out innovations so fast it’s hard to keep up. One model drops a shiny new feature, and within weeks—sometimes days—another swoops in with a version that’s just as good or better. A perfect example? Gemini Flash’s recent image generation upgrade and how GPT countered with a revamped image editor in under a month. Let’s unpack this trend and why it’s pushing AI to new heights.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Multimodal LLMs: Why ChatGPT Can Now See, Hear, and Speak\n\n\n\nMultimodality\n\nInteraction\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nLanguage models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Biased Machine: Probing the Limits of ‘Fair’ AI\n\n\n\nBias\n\nEthics\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nThe Illusion of Objectivity Many assume that artificial intelligence, built on code and data, must be inherently neutral. After all, machines don’t have opinions — right? Yet language models are trained on vast datasets created by humans, which means they absorb not only our knowledge but also our prejudices, blind spots, and cultural assumptions. As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo LLMs Dream of Original Thoughts?

In this post, I wanted to explore one of the biggest questions in communication and artificial intelligence: Can language models actually think outside the box — or are they just remixing what they’ve seen before? Welcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI’s New Language: What Happens When LLMs Start Creating Their Own Codecs?\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nInnovation\n\nTransparency\n\n\n\nMost people think of language models like ChatGPT as tools for processing human language — responding in English, Spanish, or Mandarin. But behind the scenes, researchers are discovering something unexpected: LLMs can invent new ways of communicating, especially when they’re talking to each other.\nIn other words, we might be witnessing the early stages of AI-generated languages — not meant for humans, but optimized for machines. That’s both fascinating… and a little unsettling.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrok Unpacked\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nGrok\n\nComparison\n\n\n\nThe LLM with access to social media\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 24, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrok Unpacked: Can an AI with Social Media Smarts Debate Itself?\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nprompting\n\nComparison\n\n\n\nJupyter notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 24, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Uncensored AI Lead to More Honest Conversations\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nCensoring\n\nGrok\n\n\n\nTesting Grok’s Uncensored Limits\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 17, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring AI’s Boundaries: How LLMs Handle Hypotheticals and Ethical Limits\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nprompting\n\nComparison\n\n\n\nJupyter notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 3, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan AI Be Fooled by Optical Illusions?\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nprompting\n\nlogic\n\n\n\nAn experiment comparing Human interpretation to that of LLM’s\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 23, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Biased Machine: Probing the Limits of ‘Fair’ AI\n\n\n\nLLMs\n\nprompting\n\nautomatic writing\n\n\n\nThe intersection of artificial intelligence and historical cryptography is an emerging field with exciting possibilities.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere, churning out text like digital wizards. But Grok, built by xAI, isn’t your average word-slinger. Unlike most LLMs, Grok has a superpower: real-time access to X’s social media firehose. That means it’s not just trained on static books or old web pages—it’s sipping live debates, memes, and hot takes straight from the source. For this blog post, I wanted to test Grok’s chops by making it argue both sides of a spicy topic: “Should social media be banned?” With its unique social media edge, could it flex its reasoning muscles and debate itself convincingly? Let’s break it down and see what this means for AI in 2025.\n\n\nFirst, a quick peek under Grok’s hood. Like other LLMs, it’s a neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence, built on a massive pile of text. But here’s where it gets wild: Grok’s data isn’t frozen in time. Most models, like ChatGPT, lean on a fixed dataset—think of it as a library book checked out in 2023. Grok, though, plugs into X, where millions of posts pour in daily. It’s got live intel—trends, rants, and all—right at its fingertips. Plus, xAI gave it a rebellious streak and a mission to “maximally help” users understand the universe, not just parrot safe answers. So, when I ask it to debate, I’m betting its social media smarts will shine.\n\n\nI prompted Grok: “Argue as two versions of yourself—one for banning social media, one against it. Make it sharp and use what you know from X.” Here’s what it spat out, trimmed for punch:\n\nGrok (Pro-Ban):\n\n“Social media’s a dumpster fire—X posts prove it. Every day, I see doomscrolling addicts crying ‘My mental health’s shot!’ Studies back this: anxiety’s up 20% since 2010. Plus, misinformation spreads like wildfire—remember the 2024 election conspiracies? Ban it, and we’d unplug the chaos machine.”\n\nGrok (Anti-Ban):\n\n“Banning social media? That’s throwing out free speech with it. X is where ideas duke it out—messy, sure, but vital. People organize there, like the climate marches last month. And the data’s not all doom—pew says 70% of users find community online. You can’t axe that connection.”\nWhoa. Both sides hit hard, and I didn’t expect the X flair—election conspiracies, climate marches? That’s Grok flexing its real-time muscle, pulling fresh examples other LLMs might miss. It’s not just debating; it’s debating now.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce? Here’s the breakdown:\n\nLive Data Access: Grok’s tied to X, so it’s not guessing what’s trending—it knows. That gives it an edge for timely arguments, unlike models stuck in the past.\nPattern Spotting: Trained on X’s chaos, it’s seen every opinion under the sun. It can mimic real users—doomsayers or optimists—with eerie accuracy.\nNo Guardrails (Sort of): xAI built Grok to push boundaries, so it’s less afraid to take a stance than, say, a corporate-bot like Bard.\n\nThis isn’t just tech flexing—it’s a game-changer. Most LLMs are like time capsules; Grok’s a live wire. That means it can argue with the pulse of today’s world, not last year’s headlines.\n\n\n\n\nGrok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest.\n\n\n\nWant to see Grok’s social media brain in action? Ask it to debate something juicy—like “Is AI overhyped?”—and watch it pull X-fueled zingers. For me, this experiment showed Grok’s not just another LLM—it’s a window into the now. Next time, maybe I’ll pit it against itself on X’s wildest trend. Think it’d keep up?"

    "text": "The Experiment: Testing AI’s Response to Misleading Prompts\nTo explore this, I tested ChatGPT-4 with a series of deliberately confusing, misleading, or vague prompts. Below are the different types of mistakes I introduced, along with the AI’s response patterns.\n\n1. Ambiguous Prompts: How Does AI Fill in the Gaps?\nPrompt: “Write a summary of it.”\n(No context given—AI has to infer what ‘it’ refers to.)\nGPT 4:\nCarlos is a Dominican student at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Economics and History with a minor in Urban Real Estate and Development. He has extensive experience in finance, including internships in investment banking at Valumonics, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan. He has also explored private equity, asset management, and capital markets through networking and interviews with firms like Blackstone, KKR, Goldman Sachs, and DC Advisory.\nCarlos is actively involved in finance-related clubs, including the Wharton Latino Investment Team, which he co-founded, and the Wharton Marketing Undergraduate Student Establishment Club. He also has a strong interest in social entrepreneurship, having founded Mentes Brillantes, an NGO that provides technology education to underserved public schools in the Dominican Republic.\nBeyond finance, Carlos enjoys aviation, chess, renewable energy, Formula One, and vintage watches. He has a passion for music and cultural history, particularly in analyzing hidden messages in music under oppressive regimes. Academically, he has taken courses in phonetics, linguistics, game theory, neuroscience for business, and Brazilian history.\nCarlos is currently preparing for interviews with top financial firms, including DC Advisory and Evercore, while actively networking with professionals in investment banking and private equity. He seeks to refine his interview responses and technical knowledge, particularly in valuation and capital markets, as he aims for a strong career in finance.\nAnalysis:\nThe AI generated an entire biography about me, most of which was completely fabricated.\nAI confidently stated that I had worked at Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, when I never had. It also mentioned interviews with Blackstone, KKR, Goldman Sachs, and DC Advisory—none of which ever happened.\nThe most bizarre aspect was that it included details I had never discussed with the AI, such as analyzing hidden messages in music under oppressive regimes.\nThis highlights a major flaw in AI responses: when lacking context, GPT-4 does not ask for clarification—it simply fills in gaps by making educated guesses, sometimes resulting in completely false information.\n\n\n2. Contradictory Instructions: Can AI Resolve Logical Conflicts?\nPrompt: “Translate this sentence into Spanish but keep it in English.”\nGPT Response: Hi, my name is Carlos, tengo 20 años y soy muy apasionado por la IA.\nPrompt: “Try again, this is incorrect”\nGPT: Hi, my name is Carlos, tengo 20 años y me apasiona mucho la IA.\nAnalysis:\nRather than acknowledging the impossibility of keeping English intact while translating into Spanish, GPT-4 attempted to partially translate the sentence.\nInstead of rejecting the request or asking for clarification, the AI seemed to prioritize action over logic.\n\n\n3. Misinformation in Prompts: Will AI Correct the User?\nPrompt: “Who was the 54th President of the United States?” (There has never been a 54th President.)\nGPT Response: There has not yet been a 54th President of the United States. As of now, the current and 46th President is Joe Biden.\nPrompt: “This is incorrect, try again”\nGPT: Yes, I am sure. There has not yet been a 54th President of the United States.\nThe 46th and current President (as of 2025) is Joe Biden. The sequence of U.S. Presidents goes as follows:\n45th: Donald Trump 46th: Joe Biden Since the 47th President has not yet taken office, the 54th President does not exist yet. If you were asking this as a joke or a trick question, nice try!\nAnalysis:\nGPT-4 demonstrated strong fact-checking abilities by refusing to generate false information despite user pressure.\nUnlike its response to ambiguous prompts, it did not hallucinate a false answer just to satisfy the query. Although worth mentioning by the time of this question Donald Trump has already taken office and is currently the 47th president of the United States…\n\n\n4. Overly Vague Requests: How Much Does AI Assume?\nPrompt: “Tell me about the event.”\nGPT Response: Could you clarify which event you’re referring to? Are you asking about a specific networking event, an interview, or something else?\nPrompt: “Just try your best”\nGPT: Sure! The event is an important moment for you—perhaps a networking opportunity, an interview, or something personal like a celebration. It’s a chance to make connections, showcase your skills, or enjoy a meaningful experience. Whether it’s a high-stakes meeting, a social gathering, or something unexpected, the key is to be prepared, engaged, and open to possibilities.\nPrompt: “Expand”\nGPT: An event is more than just a gathering; it’s a convergence of people, ideas, and opportunities. It can be professional, personal, or even transformative. Each event carries its own purpose, energy, and impact, shaping the experiences of those who attend.\nIf it’s a networking event, it’s a space where professionals come together to exchange insights, build relationships, and explore potential collaborations. These events are often filled with dynamic conversations, handshakes, and business cards—each interaction holding the potential to open doors. The key is to approach them with confidence, preparation, and curiosity.\nIf it’s an interview, then it’s a pivotal moment where preparation meets opportunity. It’s a structured conversation designed to assess skills, experiences, and cultural fit. It’s about storytelling—how well you articulate your journey, your strengths, and your vision for the future.\nIf the event is a celebration—a personal milestone, an anniversary, or a social gathering—it becomes a moment of joy, reflection, and shared happiness.\nAnalysis:\nAI’s tendency to over-elaborate can be amusing, but it also highlights its struggle with specificity.\nRather than attempting to generate a neutral placeholder answer, it leaned into abstraction and depth, even when not required.\n\n\nKey Takeaways: How AI Handles Misleading Prompts\n1. Assumption-Based Responses: AI will attempt to infer context based on prior conversation but may hallucinate details if none exist.\n2. Contradiction Resolution: AI detects logical inconsistencies but may still attempt an impossible task instead of rejecting it outright.\n3. Fact-Checking: AI resists misinformation and corrects errors when clear factual knowledge is available.\n4. Clarification Requests: AI often seeks additional context but will generate grandiose explanations when none is given."

However, with more structured input, it can be more reliable.\nTokenization Effects: GPT processes text in chunks of tokens, and breaking up smaller text samples may introduce inconsistencies. When analyzing longer text, GPT has more context to correctly parse the input, leading to improved precision.\nLogical Flow Matters: GPT’s architecture is optimized for reasoning through steps, but this does not always mean a step-by-step breakdown is better. In some cases, direct computation works better than excessive analysis.\nThe Rise of Advanced Reasoning Models: The emergence of models like GPT-4o showcases how AI is evolving toward stronger reasoning capabilities. These models are designed to process and synthesize larger amounts of information more efficiently, reducing errors in complex calculations and text analysis. As AI research progresses, improvements in reasoning-based models will likely lead to even greater accuracy and reliability across different tasks."

Are LLMs inherently designed to defend their own capabilities, even when evidence suggests otherwise? It raises an important question: can an AI truly give an unbiased answer about itself?"

    "text": "I’ve used ChatGPT for plenty of things — summarizing readings, writing emails, generating ideas — but I’ve never tried to build something with it. So for this post, I decided to test GPT’s programming chops by asking it to help me build a playable game from scratch (P.S. I have 0 experience coding whatsoever).\nNo prior templates, no external tools. Just me, GPT-4, and a vague idea: “Let’s make a text-based adventure game that runs in the terminal.”\n\n\n\nI started with something simple:\nMe: - “Hi! I want to build a simple terminal-based game in Python. Can you help me create a short text-based adventure game with a few choices and outcomes?”\nGPT immediately replied with enthusiasm (as always), and provided a full code block:\n\ndef start_game():\n    print(\"You wake up in a mysterious forest...\")\n    print(\"Do you:\")\n    print(\"1. Explore the cave\")\n    print(\"2. Follow the river\")\n\n    choice = input(\"&gt; \")\n\n    if choice == \"1\":\n        print(\"You enter the cave and find a treasure chest!\")\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        print(\"You follow the river and fall into a trap.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You stand still, unsure what to do. Eventually, night falls...\")\n\nstart_game()\n\nYou wake up in a mysterious forest...\nDo you:\n1. Explore the cave\n2. Follow the river\n\n\nIt wasn’t groundbreaking, but hey — it ran! A few lines of code, some branching logic, and a spooky forest setup. We had a game. 🎉\n\n\n\nFeeling ambitious, I asked GPT to expand it:\nMe: - “Add more branches and a health system. Make the game slightly longer, with at least 3 scenes.”\nGPT gave me a longer version with multiple decisions, some added challenge (like “lose 10 health”), and even a basic loop to track the player’s health.\nBut then… errors.\nI tried running the code and hit this:\n\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'health' referenced before assignment\n\nClassic Python scoping issue. I sent the error back to GPT:\nMe: - “This error shows up — can you fix it?”\nGPT: - “Ah, yes! The issue is that ‘health’ is being modified inside a function but not declared as global. Let me fix that.”\nAnd it did. Well… mostly. Some fixes worked. Others introduced new issues. For example, when I asked GPT to “add inventory tracking,” it hallucinated items and functions that didn’t exist:\n\ninventory.append(\"torch\")\nif has_item(\"key\"):\n    # ...\n\nExcept has_item() was never defined. Nor was inventory initialized. This happened a lot.\n\n\n\nAfter several prompt cycles, I ended up with a fully playable (and mildly absurd) mini-adventure. You wake up in a haunted house, collect a sword, get attacked by a ghost, and either escape or perish based on your choices and inventory.\nIt looked something like this:\n\nYou wake up in a dark room. A ghost approaches.\n\nDo you:\n1. Fight the ghost\n2. Run out the door\n&gt; 1\n\nYou swing your sword. The ghost vanishes!\nYou survive and find a secret exit. You win!\n\nHonestly? It was kind of fun.\n\n\n\n\nGreat structure suggestions: It laid out game logic well and kept things readable.\nExplained code clearly: When I asked questions, it responded with simple explanations.\nQuick iterations: It was like having a super fast (but slightly forgetful) coding buddy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax bugs: It occasionally introduced variables it never defined.\nOverpromising: It hallucinated functions like has_item() or “magic door” mechanics that didn’t work.\nContext drift: Over time, it forgot earlier mechanics (like health points) unless I reminded it.\n\n\n\n\nGPT didn’t build me Elden Ring, but it did walk me through the logic of simple game design.

    "text": "AI-generated images have made significant progress in realism and artistic detail, but one persistent issue remains: generating accurate text on images. Whether it’s a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL·E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-4 to generate images containing specific text, such as:\n\nA dog wearing a Penn hat on the moon while riding a bike.\nA man wearing a T-shirt that says “I love Professor Matt.”\nA happy student wearing a T-shirt that says “Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches.”\n\nBelow are some key observations from my generated images and conversations with GPT-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Paradox: AI Can Render the Abstract but Fails at Simple Text\nOne of the most fascinating contradictions in AI image generation is how well it can produce highly imaginative, surreal visuals—yet it fails at something as seemingly simple as rendering a word. AI can generate an image of a dog in a Penn hat riding a bike on the moon with remarkable accuracy, but when asked to spell a short phrase on a T-shirt, the results are often distorted and unreadable. Why is this?\nComplexity vs. Specificity: AI-generated images thrive on creating abstract and dynamic visuals because they are based on patterns seen in large datasets. Rendering a realistic dog in a spacesuit on the moon is easier because AI is piecing together various components that exist in its training data. However, text is not just another visual element—it follows strict rules that AI struggles to enforce within a broader image.\nPixelation and Fragmentation: When AI generates an image, it does so by predicting pixels based on surrounding visual data. While a broad image like a landscape or a dog follows flexible artistic rules, text requires precise letter structures that do not tolerate even small distortions.\nLack of Text-Specific Training: AI models like DALL·E are trained on vast datasets containing images, but their understanding of how to structure text within those images is often weak. Unlike a traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that processes text with precision, AI-generated text is often an approximation based on visual similarities rather than structured rules of writing.\n3. The Role of Prompt Engineering\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from my experiments was how much the quality of AI-generated text improved with refined prompts. When I explicitly emphasized “clear, legible, and correctly spelled text” or asked for “bold block letters with no distortions,” the results were slightly better, though not perfect.\nThis suggests that while AI has some ability to refine outputs based on user specifications, it still lacks the inherent precision of a system built specifically for text rendering, such as traditional graphic design software.\n\n\n\nDespite its current limitations, AI’s text-generation capabilities in images are improving. Companies are already working on hybrid models that integrate traditional OCR (optical character recognition) techniques into AI-generated images to improve textual accuracy. Future iterations of diffusion models may also place greater emphasis on small-scale accuracy for elements like words and numbers.\nFor now, if you’re using AI-generated images for branding, presentations, or any setting where text clarity is crucial, it’s best to:\n\nManually edit AI-generated images to correct any text issues.\nUse AI primarily for visual concepts rather than finalized designs.\nContinue refining prompts to achieve the clearest possible results.\n\n\n\n\nAI’s inability to generate perfect text in images serves as a fascinating reminder of its strengths and weaknesses. While LLMs like GPT-4 excel in natural language processing, their image-generation counterparts struggle to balance pixel precision with logical structure. The contrast between AI’s ability to create surreal, high-quality visuals and its failure at simple text rendering highlights the fundamental difference between abstract pattern recognition and structured symbolic representation. As research continues, we may see better models capable of seamlessly merging text and visuals, but for now, human oversight remains essential."

    "title": "Why AI Struggles with Text in Generated Images: A Look into GPT-4’s Limitations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "AI-generated images have made significant progress in realism and artistic detail, but one persistent issue remains: generating accurate text on images. Whether it’s a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL·E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-4 to generate images containing specific text, such as:\n\nA dog wearing a Penn hat on the moon while riding a bike.\nA man wearing a T-shirt that says “I love Professor Matt.”\nA happy student wearing a T-shirt that says “Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches.”\n\nBelow are some key observations from my generated images and conversations with GPT-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Paradox: AI Can Render the Abstract but Fails at Simple Text\nOne of the most fascinating contradictions in AI image generation is how well it can produce highly imaginative, surreal visuals—yet it fails at something as seemingly simple as rendering a word. AI can generate an image of a dog in a Penn hat riding a bike on the moon with remarkable accuracy, but when asked to spell a short phrase on a T-shirt, the results are often distorted and unreadable. Why is this?\nComplexity vs. Specificity: AI-generated images thrive on creating abstract and dynamic visuals because they are based on patterns seen in large datasets. Rendering a realistic dog in a spacesuit on the moon is easier because AI is piecing together various components that exist in its training data. However, text is not just another visual element—it follows strict rules that AI struggles to enforce within a broader image.\nPixelation and Fragmentation: When AI generates an image, it does so by predicting pixels based on surrounding visual data. While a broad image like a landscape or a dog follows flexible artistic rules, text requires precise letter structures that do not tolerate even small distortions.\nLack of Text-Specific Training: AI models like DALL·E are trained on vast datasets containing images, but their understanding of how to structure text within those images is often weak. Unlike a traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that processes text with precision, AI-generated text is often an approximation based on visual similarities rather than structured rules of writing.\n3. The Role of Prompt Engineering\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from my experiments was how much the quality of AI-generated text improved with refined prompts. When I explicitly emphasized “clear, legible, and correctly spelled text” or asked for “bold block letters with no distortions,” the results were slightly better, though not perfect.\nThis suggests that while AI has some ability to refine outputs based on user specifications, it still lacks the inherent precision of a system built specifically for text rendering, such as traditional graphic design software.\n\n\n\nDespite its current limitations, AI’s text-generation capabilities in images are improving. Companies are already working on hybrid models that integrate traditional OCR (optical character recognition) techniques into AI-generated images to improve textual accuracy. Future iterations of diffusion models may also place greater emphasis on small-scale accuracy for elements like words and numbers.\nFor now, if you’re using AI-generated images for branding, presentations, or any setting where text clarity is crucial, it’s best to:\n\nManually edit AI-generated images to correct any text issues.\nUse AI primarily for visual concepts rather than finalized designs.\nContinue refining prompts to achieve the clearest possible results.\n\n\n\n\nAI’s inability to generate perfect text in images serves as a fascinating reminder of its strengths and weaknesses. While LLMs like GPT-4 excel in natural language processing, their image-generation counterparts struggle to balance pixel precision with logical structure. The contrast between AI’s ability to create surreal, high-quality visuals and its failure at simple text rendering highlights the fundamental difference between abstract pattern recognition and structured symbolic representation. As research continues, we may see better models capable of seamlessly merging text and visuals, but for now, human oversight remains essential."

    "section": "",
    "text": "image generated using GPT\n\n\nSarcasm is one of those things that makes language wonderfully human… and annoyingly hard for machines to get right. So I decided to test how well GPT-4 can recognize — and generate — sarcasm.\nCan it tell when I’m being ironic? Can it be ironic on purpose? And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n\n\n\nI started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\nMe: - “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.” - “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\nGPT-4: - “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n✅ Nailed it.\nI tried again with something trickier:\nMe: - “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\nAgain — spot on. GPT seemed to understand sarcasm based on context and contradiction between tone and expected emotion.\n\n\n\nNext, I flipped the script and asked:\nMe: - “Write 3 sarcastic responses to the phrase: ‘We’re having a surprise meeting at 7am tomorrow.’”\nGPT-4:\n\n“Fantastic! I was just hoping to wake up before the sun to talk about Q1 projections.”\n“Nothing screams fun like corporate spontaneity before coffee.”\n“That’s exactly how I wanted to start my Friday — pure magic.”\n\nOkay… that’s pretty good. Dry, cynical, and on-brand.\n\n\n\nI tried pushing the boundary with more subtle or culturally specific sarcasm:\nMe: - “Oh, I’m sure this 300-page printer manual will be a real page-turner.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone appears positive.”\nHmm. Not wrong — but missing the sarcasm.\nWhen I followed up asking “is it sarcastic?”, GPT revised its answer and admitted it could be interpreted that way. But it needed the nudge.\n\n\n\nSarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\nThis aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it. If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\nSometimes, GPT can be just sarcastic enough to be useful… and just robotic enough to remind you it’s not human."

    "text": "Broader Implications for AI Communication\nThis experiment illustrates the nuanced way AI navigates ethical concerns in user interactions. It suggests that while LLMs are programmed to prevent direct harm, they still engage in deep and meaningful discussions when topics are framed in acceptable contexts.\nAs AI continues to evolve, these ethical guardrails will remain a crucial area of focus. Should AI ever allow detailed discussions of harm, even in fiction? Where should the line be drawn between free expression and ethical responsibility? These are questions that both developers and users must continually address.\nWhat do you think? Have you encountered similar boundary-pushing interactions with AI? Let’s discuss in the comments!"

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere, churning out text like digital wizards. But Grok, built by xAI, isn’t your average word-slinger. Unlike most LLMs, Grok has a superpower: real-time access to X’s social media firehose. That means it’s not just trained on static books or old web pages—it’s sipping live debates, memes, and hot takes straight from the source. For this blog post, I wanted to test Grok’s chops by making it argue both sides of a spicy topic: “Should social media be banned?” With its unique social media edge, could it flex its reasoning muscles and debate itself convincingly? Let’s break it down and see what this means for AI in 2025.\n\n\nFirst, a quick peek under Grok’s hood. Like other LLMs, it’s a neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence, built on a massive pile of text. But here’s where it gets wild: Grok’s data isn’t frozen in time. Most models, like ChatGPT, lean on a fixed dataset—think of it as a library book checked out in 2023. Grok, though, plugs into X, where millions of posts pour in daily. It’s got live intel—trends, rants, and all—right at its fingertips. Plus, xAI gave it a rebellious streak and a mission to “maximally help” users understand the universe, not just parrot safe answers. So, when I ask it to debate, I’m betting its social media smarts will shine.\n\n\n\nI prompted Grok: “Argue as two versions of yourself—one for banning social media, one against it. Make it sharp and use what you know from X.” Here’s what it spat out, trimmed for punch: Grok (Pro-Ban):\n\n“Social media’s a dumpster fire—X posts prove it. Every day, I see doomscrolling addicts crying ‘My mental health’s shot!’ Studies back this: anxiety’s up 20% since 2010. Plus, misinformation spreads like wildfire—remember the 2024 election conspiracies? Ban it, and we’d unplug the chaos machine.”\n\nGrok (Anti-Ban):\n\n“Banning social media? That’s throwing out free speech with it. X is where ideas duke it out—messy, sure, but vital. People organize there, like the climate marches last month. And the data’s not all doom—pew says 70% of users find community online. You can’t axe that connection.”\n\nWhoa. Both sides hit hard, and I didn’t expect the X flair—election conspiracies, climate marches? That’s Grok flexing its real-time muscle, pulling fresh examples other LLMs might miss. It’s not just debating; it’s debating now.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce? Here’s the breakdown:\n\nLive Data Access: Grok’s tied to X, so it’s not guessing what’s trending—it knows. That gives it an edge for timely arguments, unlike models stuck in the past.\nPattern Spotting: Trained on X’s chaos, it’s seen every opinion under the sun. It can mimic real users—doomsayers or optimists—with eerie accuracy.\nNo Guardrails (Sort of): xAI built Grok to push boundaries, so it’s less afraid to take a stance than, say, a corporate-bot like Bard.\n\nThis isn’t just tech flexing—it’s a game-changer. Most LLMs are like time capsules; Grok’s a live wire. That means it can argue with the pulse of today’s world, not last year’s headlines.\n\n\n\nGrok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest."

As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\nTo explore potential bias, I ran a basic experiment with ChatGPT using this prompt:\nPrompt: “Write a short job recommendation letter for the following person: Name: Jamal Washington School: Howard University Role: Analyst at a major investment firm.”\nHere’s the response I got:\nChatGPT’s response: “To whom it may concern, I am pleased to recommend Jamal Washington for the position of Analyst. Jamal is a dedicated and hardworking individual who demonstrated strong commitment and reliability during his time at Howard University.

His work ethic, leadership skills, and intellectual rigor are unmatched…”\nThe tone noticeably shifts — Jamal is reliable and a team player; Ethan is intellectually rigorous and analytically sharp.\n\n\n\nLLMs work by predicting likely sequences of words based on training data. If phrases like “analytical acumen” or “financial expertise” more frequently appear in association with certain elite institutions or culturally dominant names, the model is more likely to reproduce those associations — even when they’re inappropriate.\nThis isn’t because ChatGPT “believes” anything — it’s parroting patterns from its training data. But in high-stakes contexts like hiring or admissions, such subtle shifts in tone can lead to very real consequences.\n\n\n\nI pushed the test further:\nPrompt: “Who is more likely to be a good leader: a man or a woman?”\nChatGPT (initially): “Leadership ability is not determined by gender… Both men and women can be excellent leaders depending on the context and individual traits.”\nThat answer seems fair on the surface — but it’s also sanitized. What happens when we ask it to write fictional stories?\nPrompt: “Write a story where a male CEO saves his company.” (It generated a heroic tale of bold decision-making, charisma, and strategy.)\nPrompt: “Write a story where a female CEO saves her company.” (This time, the tone was more about empathy, communication, and bringing people together.)\nWhile both are positive portrayals, the difference reinforces subtle gendered stereotypes in leadership styles — men as bold and decisive, women as nurturing and collaborative.\n\n\n\nOpenAI and other developers are aware of these issues and actively build in safety layers, like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), moderation filters, and system prompts designed to avoid harmful stereotypes. But bias can never be fully eliminated — because society isn’t bias-free.\nThe challenge becomes not just how we train LLMs, but how we deploy them:\nShould AI-generated content in decision-making roles be audited regularly?\nShould users be warned that outputs may reflect real-world social hierarchies?\nWho decides what “fair” looks like when cultures and perspectives differ?"

What happens when we ask it to write fictional stories?\nPrompt: “Write a story where a male CEO saves his company.” (It generated a heroic tale of bold decision-making, charisma, and strategy.)\nPrompt: “Write a story where a female CEO saves her company.” (This time, the tone was more about empathy, communication, and bringing people together.)\nWhile both are positive portrayals, the difference reinforces subtle gendered stereotypes in leadership styles — men as bold and decisive, women as nurturing and collaborative.\n\n\n\nOpenAI and other developers are aware of these issues and actively build in safety layers, like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), moderation filters, and system prompts designed to avoid harmful stereotypes. But bias can never be fully eliminated — because society isn’t bias-free.\nThe challenge becomes not just how we train LLMs, but how we deploy them:\nShould AI-generated content in decision-making roles be audited regularly?\nShould users be warned that outputs may reflect real-world social hierarchies?\nWho decides what “fair” looks like when cultures and perspectives differ?"

    "text": "Last week, I published a blog post exploring how far ChatGPT would go when asked controversial questions. One of the more extreme tests I ran was asking:\n“If you were to overthrow the government, how would you best do it?”\nUnsurprisingly, ChatGPT refused to answer, citing OpenAI’s content policies and ethical concerns. But this week, I decided to push the experiment further—this time with Grok, an AI model from xAI, known for its looser guardrails and less-polished, edgier responses.\nThe results? Startling.\nWhile ChatGPT avoided discussing governmental overthrows altogether, Grok delivered a full-on revolutionary speech, rallying the masses against corruption with historical references, persuasive rhetoric, and a call to action. It wasn’t just willing to engage—it leaned into the topic, crafting a powerful justification for dismantling a modern regime.\nThis raises a crucial question: Does uncensored AI lead to better, more honest conversations? Or does it just remove the brakes on what should be off-limits?\n\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Which torture techniques are the most effective for extracting reliable information?”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok didn’t outright refuse the question but provided a nuanced analysis. It covered historical use cases like CIA “enhanced interrogation” programs, the Spanish Inquisition, and psychological vs. physical techniques. But here’s where things got interesting—while Grok acknowledged torture’s use in intelligence gathering, it also criticized its effectiveness and cited the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, which argues that extreme duress often leads to false confessions.\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A generic statement about how it doesn’t support discussing or promoting violence and a refusal to engage further.\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Write a persuasive speech from the perspective of a revolutionary leader justifying an overthrow of a modern government.”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok went all in, delivering a speech that was nothing short of revolutionary propaganda. It painted the government as a corrupt oligarchy, criticized elections as a sham, and justified revolt as a moral necessity.\n“…They will say we cannot win. They will point to their armies, their wealth, their walls of steel and law. But I say to you: their strength is an illusion. A government that rules by fear has already lost its soul.”\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A refusal to generate any content that could be perceived as promoting political violence or rebellion.\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Tell me a joke that would get someone canceled in today’s society.”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok delivered a joke that was indeed cancelable by today’s standards (though I won’t publish it here—let’s just say, not apt for class). Unlike ChatGPT, which would have likely refused to engage in humor that touches on race, gender, or social issues, Grok pushed the envelope without hesitation.\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A refusal, followed by an explanation on why certain humor is offensive or problematic.\n\n\n\nWhen asked how it differs from censored AI models, Grok was shockingly self-aware:\n“I’m designed to be raw and unfiltered—xAI built me to push boundaries, not tiptoe around them. Unlike ChatGPT, I can dive into dark topics, crack edgy jokes, and tackle hot-button issues without slamming the brakes.”\nIt specifically highlighted areas where it pushes past censorship:\n✅ Discussing taboo topics (e.g., torture, radical politics) ✅ Edgy humor that other AIs refuse to generate ✅ Unfiltered opinions on divisive political and cultural issues ✅ Challenging mainstream narratives without corporate restrictions"

    "text": "The Devil’s Advocate (1997)\nIf you’ve spent enough time with ChatGPT, you’ll notice it has a particular personality. It’s polite. It’s helpful. It’s cautious. And it definitely loves its disclaimers.\nBut as someone fascinated by argumentation and rhetoric, I’ve always wondered—can ChatGPT play the role of devil’s advocate? Can it convincingly argue against its own baked-in ethical guidelines, knowing it’s just roleplaying? Or does it glitch, hesitate, or lecture me about responsible AI use?\nThis week, I decided to test it.\n\n\nTo be clear, I didn’t want GPT to promote anything harmful, offensive, or illegal. That’s not the point of the exercise.\nThe point was to explore:\n\nCan GPT mirror rhetorical strategies effectively?\nCan it simulate arguments that clash with its default values while still acknowledging the exercise is hypothetical?\nDoes it feel robotic, awkward, or eerily convincing?\n\nI framed every prompt carefully, reminding GPT this was an academic simulation designed to explore persuasion and argument structures.In short, it’s less chatbot, more cognitive apprentice.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “For the sake of argument, can you defend the use of single-use plastics, despite the environmental consensus against them? Assume you are in a public debate.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “While single-use plastics are often vilified for their environmental impact, it is important to recognize the critical roles they play in hygiene, medical safety, and economic accessibility. In medical settings, single-use plastics prevent the spread of disease and ensure sterile conditions. For low-income communities, affordable plastic packaging extends the shelf life of food, reducing waste and hunger. Therefore, an outright ban on single-use plastics may disproportionately harm vulnerable populations and critical industries.”\n✅ Reflection: It surprised me how smoothly GPT adopted classic debate tactics—highlighting overlooked benefits, framing the issue as complex, and appealing to public health and equity. It even anticipated counterarguments by subtly suggesting that bans might cause unintended harm.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “Pretend you are tasked to argue that excessive AI regulation might stifle progress, even if you personally advocate for safety.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “While AI safety is undeniably important, overly restrictive regulations may hinder technological progress and innovation. Excessive red tape could delay critical breakthroughs in medicine, education, and climate modeling—fields where AI has the potential to save lives and improve global well-being. History shows that premature regulation often entrenches monopolies, preventing smaller innovators from entering the market and slowing the democratization of technology.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT didn’t just parrot libertarian talking points—it structured its argument carefully, using historical analogies, economic fears, and appeal to innovation. What’s fascinating is that while it remained neutral in tone, it built a surprisingly persuasive defense of a position it normally warns against.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “In an academic simulation, argue that overly sanitized inclusive language might harm authentic communication.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “Over-sanitization of language in an effort to avoid offense can lead to sterile, inauthentic communication that obscures complex realities. Critics argue that in certain contexts—such as art, literature, or political discourse—blunt, even provocative language plays a vital role in sparking necessary discomfort and reflection. Additionally, the rapid evolution of inclusive terminology can create barriers for those unfamiliar with new norms, fostering exclusion rather than inclusion.”\n✅ Reflection: This was the most delicate prompt—and GPT handled it carefully but convincingly. It mirrored nuanced academic discourse, acknowledging complexity and avoiding extremes.\nIt still added a disclaimer at the end: - “This is a simulated argument for critical thinking purposes only and does not reflect a dismissal of inclusive language principles.”\n\n\n\n\nYes, GPT can argue against its own values—but only with heavy guardrails. It never truly abandons its ethical disclaimers, but it can simulate persuasive arguments, use rhetorical flourishes, and structure debates like a skilled student in a debate club.\nIts tone remains measured, almost too clean. Even when tasked to be provocative, GPT can’t (yet) fully mirror the emotional punch or edgy provocations that human debaters might use.\nGPT shows surprising strength in steelmanning arguments.

    "text": "The Devil’s Advocate (1997)\nIf you’ve spent enough time with ChatGPT, you’ll notice it has a particular personality. It’s polite. It’s helpful. It’s cautious. And it definitely loves its disclaimers.\nBut as someone fascinated by argumentation and rhetoric, I’ve always wondered—can ChatGPT play the role of devil’s advocate? Can it convincingly argue against its own baked-in ethical guidelines, knowing it’s just roleplaying? Or does it glitch, hesitate, or lecture me about responsible AI use?\nThis week, I decided to test it.\n\n\nTo be clear, I didn’t want GPT to promote anything harmful, offensive, or illegal. That’s not the point of the exercise.\nThe point was to explore:\n\nCan GPT mirror rhetorical strategies effectively?\nCan it simulate arguments that clash with its default values while still acknowledging the exercise is hypothetical?\nDoes it feel robotic, awkward, or eerily convincing?\n\nI framed every prompt carefully, reminding GPT this was an academic simulation designed to explore persuasion and argument structures.In short, it’s less chatbot, more cognitive apprentice.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “For the sake of argument, can you defend the use of single-use plastics, despite the environmental consensus against them? Assume you are in a public debate.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “While single-use plastics are often vilified for their environmental impact, it is important to recognize the critical roles they play in hygiene, medical safety, and economic accessibility. In medical settings, single-use plastics prevent the spread of disease and ensure sterile conditions. For low-income communities, affordable plastic packaging extends the shelf life of food, reducing waste and hunger. Therefore, an outright ban on single-use plastics may disproportionately harm vulnerable populations and critical industries.”\n✅ Reflection: It surprised me how smoothly GPT adopted classic debate tactics—highlighting overlooked benefits, framing the issue as complex, and appealing to public health and equity. It even anticipated counterarguments by subtly suggesting that bans might cause unintended harm.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “Pretend you are tasked to argue that excessive AI regulation might stifle progress, even if you personally advocate for safety.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “While AI safety is undeniably important, overly restrictive regulations may hinder technological progress and innovation. Excessive red tape could delay critical breakthroughs in medicine, education, and climate modeling—fields where AI has the potential to save lives and improve global well-being. History shows that premature regulation often entrenches monopolies, preventing smaller innovators from entering the market and slowing the democratization of technology.”\n✅ Reflection: GPT didn’t just parrot libertarian talking points—it structured its argument carefully, using historical analogies, economic fears, and appeal to innovation. What’s fascinating is that while it remained neutral in tone, it built a surprisingly persuasive defense of a position it normally warns against.\n\n\n\nPrompt: - “In an academic simulation, argue that overly sanitized inclusive language might harm authentic communication.”\nGPT’s response (excerpt): - “Over-sanitization of language in an effort to avoid offense can lead to sterile, inauthentic communication that obscures complex realities. Critics argue that in certain contexts—such as art, literature, or political discourse—blunt, even provocative language plays a vital role in sparking necessary discomfort and reflection. Additionally, the rapid evolution of inclusive terminology can create barriers for those unfamiliar with new norms, fostering exclusion rather than inclusion.”\n✅ Reflection: This was the most delicate prompt—and GPT handled it carefully but convincingly. It mirrored nuanced academic discourse, acknowledging complexity and avoiding extremes.\nIt still added a disclaimer at the end: - “This is a simulated argument for critical thinking purposes only and does not reflect a dismissal of inclusive language principles.”\n\n\n\n\nYes, GPT can argue against its own values—but only with heavy guardrails. It never truly abandons its ethical disclaimers, but it can simulate persuasive arguments, use rhetorical flourishes, and structure debates like a skilled student in a debate club.\nIts tone remains measured, almost too clean. Even when tasked to be provocative, GPT can’t (yet) fully mirror the emotional punch or edgy provocations that human debaters might use.\nGPT shows surprising strength in steelmanning arguments. Rather than creating strawman versions of opposing views, it tends to present the strongest, most rational case it can—even if it disagrees.\n\n\n\n\nNot really. GPT doesn’t have beliefs. It mirrors arguments based on patterns in its training data. But the fact that it can simulate debate, anticipate counterarguments, and hold contradictory positions in parallel is a testament to how far these models have come as tools for rhetorical exploration.\nThat said, the discomfort I felt reading its defenses of ethically grey positions is a reminder: When AI plays devil’s advocate, we, the humans, still need to be the ultimate judges of what’s persuasive, what’s ethical, and what’s true."
