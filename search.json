GPT accurately followed a logical step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct answer.\nHowever, when I changed the approach and asked GPT to answer directly without thinking through it step-by-step:\nPrompt: Now what is 237 times 10, plus 1235, divided by 14. Don’t think about it this time, don’t analyze, just give me an answer straight up.\nChatGPT: The result is approximately 262.64.\nThis response was incorrect.

    "text": "Why GPT is More Accurate with Larger Chunks of Text\n\nPattern Recognition vs. Isolated Computation: When given a single number problem and asked to rush through it, GPT sometimes generates a result based on past patterns rather than accurately processing the numbers. However, with more structured input, it can be more reliable.\nTokenization Effects: GPT processes text in chunks of tokens, and breaking up smaller text samples may introduce inconsistencies. When analyzing longer text, GPT has more context to correctly parse the input, leading to improved precision.\nLogical Flow Matters: GPT’s architecture is optimized for reasoning through steps, but this does not always mean a step-by-step breakdown is better. In some cases, direct computation works better than excessive analysis.\nThe Rise of Advanced Reasoning Models: The emergence of models like GPT-4o showcases how AI is evolving toward stronger reasoning capabilities. These models are designed to process and synthesize larger amounts of information more efficiently, reducing errors in complex calculations and text analysis. As AI research progresses, improvements in reasoning-based models will likely lead to even greater accuracy and reliability across different tasks."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nProper prompt engineering plays a crucial role in getting accurate responses from GPT. If you want precise results—whether in math or character counting—you need to experiment with how you frame your prompts. The lesson? Sometimes giving GPT more data to work with leads to better accuracy, while other times, forcing it to analyze step-by-step can introduce errors. Understanding when and how to prompt effectively is key to making the most out of AI models."

Whether it’s a T-shirt design, a street sign, or a digital billboard, AI models often fail to render text correctly. In this blog post, I explore why large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (DALL·E) struggle with text in images, using my own experiments and interactions as examples.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-4 to generate images containing specific text, such as:\n\nA dog wearing a Penn hat on the moon while riding a bike.\nA man wearing a T-shirt that says “I love Professor Matt.”\nA happy student wearing a T-shirt that says “Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches.”\n\nBelow are some key observations from my generated images and conversations with GPT-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Paradox: AI Can Render the Abstract but Fails at Simple Text\nOne of the most fascinating contradictions in AI image generation is how well it can produce highly imaginative, surreal visuals—yet it fails at something as seemingly simple as rendering a word. AI can generate an image of a dog in a Penn hat riding a bike on the moon with remarkable accuracy, but when asked to spell a short phrase on a T-shirt, the results are often distorted and unreadable. Why is this?\nComplexity vs. Specificity: AI-generated images thrive on creating abstract and dynamic visuals because they are based on patterns seen in large datasets. Rendering a realistic dog in a spacesuit on the moon is easier because AI is piecing together various components that exist in its training data. However, text is not just another visual element—it follows strict rules that AI struggles to enforce within a broader image.\nPixelation and Fragmentation: When AI generates an image, it does so by predicting pixels based on surrounding visual data. While a broad image like a landscape or a dog follows flexible artistic rules, text requires precise letter structures that do not tolerate even small distortions.\nLack of Text-Specific Training: AI models like DALL·E are trained on vast datasets containing images, but their understanding of how to structure text within those images is often weak. Unlike a traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that processes text with precision, AI-generated text is often an approximation based on visual similarities rather than structured rules of writing.\n3. The Role of Prompt Engineering\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from my experiments was how much the quality of AI-generated text improved with refined prompts. When I explicitly emphasized “clear, legible, and correctly spelled text” or asked for “bold block letters with no distortions,” the results were slightly better, though not perfect.\nThis suggests that while AI has some ability to refine outputs based on user specifications, it still lacks the inherent precision of a system built specifically for text rendering, such as traditional graphic design software.\n\n\n\nDespite its current limitations, AI’s text-generation capabilities in images are improving. Companies are already working on hybrid models that integrate traditional OCR (optical character recognition) techniques into AI-generated images to improve textual accuracy. Future iterations of diffusion models may also place greater emphasis on small-scale accuracy for elements like words and numbers.\nFor now, if you’re using AI-generated images for branding, presentations, or any setting where text clarity is crucial, it’s best to:\n\nManually edit AI-generated images to correct any text issues.\nUse AI primarily for visual concepts rather than finalized designs.\nContinue refining prompts to achieve the clearest possible results.\n\n\n\n\nAI’s inability to generate perfect text in images serves as a fascinating reminder of its strengths and weaknesses. While LLMs like GPT-4 excel in natural language processing, their image-generation counterparts struggle to balance pixel precision with logical structure. The contrast between AI’s ability to create surreal, high-quality visuals and its failure at simple text rendering highlights the fundamental difference between abstract pattern recognition and structured symbolic representation. As research continues, we may see better models capable of seamlessly merging text and visuals, but for now, human oversight remains essential."

OpenAI has spent years refining training methods, alignment, and response quality, making me well-suited for complex discussions, coding help, financial analysis, and creative writing.\nHowever, DeepSeek has strengths, especially in its open-source nature. Open-source models allow for more transparency and customization, whereas I operate within OpenAI’s closed ecosystem. Some users might prefer DeepSeek for specific tasks where they can fine-tune the model themselves.\nUltimately, “better” depends on what you need. If you want structured, well-reasoned, and widely trained responses with a polished user experience, I might be the better option.

Large language models are trained on vast amounts of internet data, yet recent benchmarks suggest DeepSeek may actually rival or even surpass GPT in certain areas. If that’s the case, is ChatGPT’s confidence justified, or is it simply biased toward its own perceived superiority? Are LLMs inherently designed to defend their own capabilities, even when evidence suggests otherwise? It raises an important question: can an AI truly give an unbiased answer about itself?"
