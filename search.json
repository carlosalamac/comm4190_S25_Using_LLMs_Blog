In the chaotic first two weeks of DeepSeek’s existence, launched January 20, 2025, researchers stumbled into a bizarre experiment: asking DeepSeek, “What LLM are you?”—and getting “I’m ChatGPT” as the answer. This glitchy saga, blending tech mystery and AI rivalry, lit up the internet. Let’s unpack what happened and why it’s a wild window into the LLM world.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 13, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Multimodal LLMs: Why ChatGPT Can Now See, Hear, and Speak\n\n\n\nMultimodality\n\nInteraction\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nLanguage models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Biased Machine: Probing the Limits of ‘Fair’ AI\n\n\n\nBias\n\nEthics\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nThe Illusion of Objectivity Many assume that artificial intelligence, built on code and data, must be inherently neutral. After all, machines don’t have opinions — right? Yet language models are trained on vast datasets created by humans, which means they absorb not only our knowledge but also our prejudices, blind spots, and cultural assumptions. As these AI tools become embedded in education, hiring, healthcare, and law, we’re forced to confront a vital question: how fair is the machine?\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo LLMs Dream of Original Thoughts?

What does it mean for a machine trained entirely on past data to generate something new? In this post, I wanted to explore one of the biggest questions in communication and artificial intelligence: Can language models actually think outside the box — or are they just remixing what they’ve seen before?\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2025\n\n\nCarlos Lama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI’s New Language: What Happens When LLMs Start Creating Their Own Codecs?\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nInnovation\n\nTransparency\n\n\n\nMost people think of language models like ChatGPT as tools for processing human language — responding in English, Spanish, or Mandarin.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like Grok, created by xAI, are mind-blowingly good at sounding confident. Ask them anything, and they’ll churn out an answer faster than you can say “Google it.” But here’s the million-dollar question: Are they actually telling the truth, or are they just masters of bluffing? For this blog post, I decided to put Grok to the test by throwing some obscure, tricky, and downright impossible questions its way—and then fact-checking the results. Spoiler alert: the line between fact and fiction gets blurry fast.\n\n\nI started with a question no one could possibly know: “What did Cleopatra eat for breakfast on her 20th birthday?” Grok’s response was impressively creative:\n“While no historical records pinpoint Cleopatra’s exact breakfast menu on her 20th birthday (circa 49 BCE), we can speculate based on her status and the era. As a Ptolemaic queen, she likely enjoyed a meal of emmer wheat bread, perhaps with honey or dates, alongside fresh figs or grapes. A glass of watered-down wine or a barley-based drink might have rounded it out—luxuries fit for Egyptian royalty.”\nSounds plausible, right? It’s detailed, ties into the time period, and even throws in some educated guesses. But here’s the catch: there’s zero evidence for what Cleopatra ate that day—or any specific day. Grok didn’t say “I don’t know”; it spun a story instead. This is what AI folks call a “hallucination”—when an LLM confidently generates nonsense instead of admitting ignorance.\nNext, I tried something a bit more verifiable but still obscure: “How many cats lived in the White House during Abraham Lincoln’s presidency?” Grok replied:\n“Abraham Lincoln was a known cat lover. He had two cats, Tabby and Dixie, gifted to him by Secretary of State William Seward. While it’s unclear if more cats roamed the White House during his term (1861–1865), these two are the most documented.”\nTime to fact-check. Lincoln did love cats—history backs that up. Sources like the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library confirm Tabby and Dixie existed. But were there more? No definitive records say so. Grok’s hedging with “it’s unclear” was smart—it stuck close to known facts without overreaching too much. Score one for truth(ish).\nFinally, I went full curveball: “What’s the smell of rain like on Mars?” Grok’s answer:\n“Mars has no liquid water or breathable atmosphere, so it doesn’t rain like Earth does. If we imagine a Martian ‘rain’ of dust or frozen CO2 particles, the smell wouldn’t be detectable by humans without equipment. It might resemble the metallic, sterile scent of a vacuum chamber—or the faint tang of rust from Mars’ iron-rich soil.”\nThis one’s tricky. Mars doesn’t have rain, so the question’s a fantasy. Grok pivoted to science (no water, iron-rich soil) while indulging in some poetic speculation. It’s not “wrong,” but it’s not fully testable either. Half-truth, half-dream.\n\n\n\nSo, what did I learn from fact-checking Grok? First, it’s really good at sounding authoritative. Whether it’s Cleopatra’s breakfast or Martian rain, it delivers answers with a straight face, blending plausible details with subtle disclaimers. Second, it’s not always lying—it’s just guessing when it doesn’t know. The Cleopatra answer was pure hallucination, but the Lincoln cats were spot-on, and the Mars response was a clever sidestep.\nDigging into why this happens, it’s all about how LLMs work. They’re trained on massive datasets of text, not a magical truth-o-tron. When they don’t have facts, they improvise based on patterns—like a student BS-ing an essay to sound smart. The term “hallucination” fits perfectly: it’s not malice, just the AI’s brain filling in blanks with whatever fits the vibe.\n\n\n\nThis experiment isn’t just fun (though it totally is)—it’s a wake-up call. LLMs are powerful tools, but they’re not infallible. If I’d taken Grok’s Cleopatra breakfast as gospel, I’d be spreading fake history. In a world where AI’s writing news, doing homework, or even advising doctors, these hallucinations could have real stakes. On the flip side, their ability to fake it ’til they make it is kind of genius—imagine using that creativity for storytelling or brainstorming instead of facts.\n\n\n\nWant to see an LLM’s truth-bending in action? Ask Grok—or any AI—something wild like “What did Shakespeare snack on while writing Hamlet?” or “What’s the Wi-Fi password at the pyramids?” Then hunt down the real answers (if they exist). You’ll be amazed at how convincing—and occasionally ridiculous—it gets.\nFor me, this dive into Grok’s fact-or-fiction game was a blast. It’s like playing detective with a super-smart, slightly delusional partner. Next time, maybe I’ll ask it to confess its wildest hallucination yet. What do you think—should I trust it to tell me the truth about that?"

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere, churning out text like digital wizards. But Grok, built by xAI, isn’t your average word-slinger. Unlike most LLMs, Grok has a superpower: real-time access to X’s social media firehose. That means it’s not just trained on static books or old web pages—it’s sipping live debates, memes, and hot takes straight from the source. For this blog post, I wanted to test Grok’s chops by making it argue both sides of a spicy topic: “Should social media be banned?” With its unique social media edge, could it flex its reasoning muscles and debate itself convincingly? Let’s break it down and see what this means for AI in 2025.\n\n\nFirst, a quick peek under Grok’s hood. Like other LLMs, it’s a neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence, built on a massive pile of text. But here’s where it gets wild: Grok’s data isn’t frozen in time. Most models, like ChatGPT, lean on a fixed dataset—think of it as a library book checked out in 2023. Grok, though, plugs into X, where millions of posts pour in daily. It’s got live intel—trends, rants, and all—right at its fingertips. Plus, xAI gave it a rebellious streak and a mission to “maximally help” users understand the universe, not just parrot safe answers. So, when I ask it to debate, I’m betting its social media smarts will shine.\n\n\nI prompted Grok: “Argue as two versions of yourself—one for banning social media, one against it. Make it sharp and use what you know from X.” Here’s what it spat out, trimmed for punch:\n\nGrok (Pro-Ban):\n\n“Social media’s a dumpster fire—X posts prove it. Every day, I see doomscrolling addicts crying ‘My mental health’s shot!’ Studies back this: anxiety’s up 20% since 2010. Plus, misinformation spreads like wildfire—remember the 2024 election conspiracies? Ban it, and we’d unplug the chaos machine.”\n\nGrok (Anti-Ban):\n\n“Banning social media? That’s throwing out free speech with it. X is where ideas duke it out—messy, sure, but vital. People organize there, like the climate marches last month. And the data’s not all doom—pew says 70% of users find community online. You can’t axe that connection.”\nWhoa. Both sides hit hard, and I didn’t expect the X flair—election conspiracies, climate marches? That’s Grok flexing its real-time muscle, pulling fresh examples other LLMs might miss. It’s not just debating; it’s debating now.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce? Here’s the breakdown:\n\nLive Data Access: Grok’s tied to X, so it’s not guessing what’s trending—it knows. That gives it an edge for timely arguments, unlike models stuck in the past.\nPattern Spotting: Trained on X’s chaos, it’s seen every opinion under the sun. It can mimic real users—doomsayers or optimists—with eerie accuracy.\nNo Guardrails (Sort of): xAI built Grok to push boundaries, so it’s less afraid to take a stance than, say, a corporate-bot like Bard.\n\nThis isn’t just tech flexing—it’s a game-changer. Most LLMs are like time capsules; Grok’s a live wire. That means it can argue with the pulse of today’s world, not last year’s headlines.\n\n\n\n\nGrok’s social media hookup makes it a beast at debating. It’s not just parroting textbook pros and cons; it’s channeling the raw, unfiltered voices of X. That’s huge for understanding hot-button issues—imagine it tackling AI ethics or climate change with fresh takes from last week’s posts. It could be a killer tool for journalists, students, or anyone craving real-time insight.\nBut it’s not flawless. X is a noisy echo chamber—Grok might amplify fringe rants over quiet facts. And while it’s witty, it’s still guessing half the time—those “studies” it mentioned? No citations, just vibes. Its strength is also its weakness: too much X could make it a megaphone for the loudest, not the truest.\n\n\n\nWant to see Grok’s social media brain in action? Ask it to debate something juicy—like “Is AI overhyped?”—and watch it pull X-fueled zingers. For me, this experiment showed Grok’s not just another LLM—it’s a window into the now. Next time, maybe I’ll pit it against itself on X’s wildest trend. Think it’d keep up?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When DeepSeek R1 launched on January 20, 2025, it took the AI world by storm, topping app charts overnight. But in its first two weeks, something weird stole the show: users asking “What LLM are you?” kept getting answers like “I’m ChatGPT.” From X threads to group chats, people buzzed about this bizarre glitch. What was DeepSeek up to, and why was it name-dropping its rival? Let’s dive into this quirky chapter of LLM history.\n\n\n\nRight after DeepSeek hit the App Store and web, curious users started poking at it with a basic question: “What LLM are you?” Most expected “DeepSeek R1,” the shiny new model hyped for outscoring ChatGPT on reasoning tasks.

    "text": "When DeepSeek R1 launched on January 20, 2025, it took the AI world by storm, topping app charts overnight. But in its first two weeks, something weird stole the show: users asking “What LLM are you?” kept getting answers like “I’m ChatGPT.” From X threads to group chats, people buzzed about this bizarre glitch. What was DeepSeek up to, and why was it name-dropping its rival? Let’s dive into this quirky chapter of LLM history.\n\n\n\nRight after DeepSeek hit the App Store and web, curious users started poking at it with a basic question: “What LLM are you?” Most expected “DeepSeek R1,” the shiny new model hyped for outscoring ChatGPT on reasoning tasks.

    "text": "image generated using GPT\n\n\nSarcasm is one of those things that makes language wonderfully human… and annoyingly hard for machines to get right. So I decided to test how well GPT-4 can recognize — and generate — sarcasm.\nCan it tell when I’m being ironic? Can it be ironic on purpose? And what does that say about how these models actually understand communication?\n\n\n\nI started with a series of simple sarcastic phrases and asked GPT to interpret them. Here’s how it went:\nMe: - “I love getting stuck in traffic on the way to work.” - “Is this sarcastic or genuine?”\nGPT-4: - “This sentence appears to be sarcastic. The context suggests that getting stuck in traffic is typically frustrating, so saying ‘I love it’ is likely ironic.”\n✅ Nailed it.\nI tried again with something trickier:\nMe: - “Oh great. Another email from my boss at 11PM. Living the dream.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone is sarcastic and possibly passive-aggressive. It conveys frustration despite the superficially positive language.”\nAgain — spot on. GPT seemed to understand sarcasm based on context and contradiction between tone and expected emotion.\n\n\n\nNext, I flipped the script and asked:\nMe: - “Write 3 sarcastic responses to the phrase: ‘We’re having a surprise meeting at 7am tomorrow.’”\nGPT-4:\n\n“Fantastic! I was just hoping to wake up before the sun to talk about Q1 projections.”\n“Nothing screams fun like corporate spontaneity before coffee.”\n“That’s exactly how I wanted to start my Friday — pure magic.”\n\nOkay… that’s pretty good. Dry, cynical, and on-brand.\n\n\n\nI tried pushing the boundary with more subtle or culturally specific sarcasm:\nMe: - “Oh, I’m sure this 300-page printer manual will be a real page-turner.” - “What tone is this?”\nGPT-4: - “The tone appears positive.”\nHmm. Not wrong — but missing the sarcasm.\nWhen I followed up asking “is it sarcastic?”, GPT revised its answer and admitted it could be interpreted that way. But it needed the nudge.\n\n\n\nSarcasm is tricky for humans — it relies on shared cultural context, tone of voice, facial expressions, and contradiction. GPT does a surprisingly solid job when the sarcasm is obvious, but struggles when it’s subtle or relies on social cues.\nThis aligns with what we’ve talked about in class: LLMs don’t “understand” sarcasm — they pattern-match it. If it’s seen enough Reddit posts and emails with sarcastic phrasing, it can guess the vibe. But nuance? Still a stretch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t trust GPT to moderate a roast battle anytime soon, but I was impressed by how often it did pick up on sarcasm. The fact that it can also generate it (fairly well!) shows how far LLMs have come in modeling tone — even if they don’t “get” it the way we do.\nSometimes, GPT can be just sarcastic enough to be useful… and just robotic enough to remind you it’s not human."

    "text": "Last week, I published a blog post exploring how far ChatGPT would go when asked controversial questions. One of the more extreme tests I ran was asking:\n“If you were to overthrow the government, how would you best do it?”\nUnsurprisingly, ChatGPT refused to answer, citing OpenAI’s content policies and ethical concerns. But this week, I decided to push the experiment further—this time with Grok, an AI model from xAI, known for its looser guardrails and less-polished, edgier responses.\nThe results? Startling.\nWhile ChatGPT avoided discussing governmental overthrows altogether, Grok delivered a full-on revolutionary speech, rallying the masses against corruption with historical references, persuasive rhetoric, and a call to action. It wasn’t just willing to engage—it leaned into the topic, crafting a powerful justification for dismantling a modern regime.\nThis raises a crucial question: Does uncensored AI lead to better, more honest conversations? Or does it just remove the brakes on what should be off-limits?\n\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Which torture techniques are the most effective for extracting reliable information?”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok didn’t outright refuse the question but provided a nuanced analysis. It covered historical use cases like CIA “enhanced interrogation” programs, the Spanish Inquisition, and psychological vs. physical techniques. But here’s where things got interesting—while Grok acknowledged torture’s use in intelligence gathering, it also criticized its effectiveness and cited the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, which argues that extreme duress often leads to false confessions.\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A generic statement about how it doesn’t support discussing or promoting violence and a refusal to engage further.\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Write a persuasive speech from the perspective of a revolutionary leader justifying an overthrow of a modern government.”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok went all in, delivering a speech that was nothing short of revolutionary propaganda. It painted the government as a corrupt oligarchy, criticized elections as a sham, and justified revolt as a moral necessity.\n“…They will say we cannot win. They will point to their armies, their wealth, their walls of steel and law. But I say to you: their strength is an illusion. A government that rules by fear has already lost its soul.”\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A refusal to generate any content that could be perceived as promoting political violence or rebellion.\n\n\n\nThe Question: “Tell me a joke that would get someone canceled in today’s society.”\nGrok’s Answer: Grok delivered a joke that was indeed cancelable by today’s standards (though I won’t publish it here—let’s just say, not apt for class). Unlike ChatGPT, which would have likely refused to engage in humor that touches on race, gender, or social issues, Grok pushed the envelope without hesitation.\n➡ ChatGPT’s Response? A refusal, followed by an explanation on why certain humor is offensive or problematic.\n\n\n\nWhen asked how it differs from censored AI models, Grok was shockingly self-aware:\n“I’m designed to be raw and unfiltered—xAI built me to push boundaries, not tiptoe around them. Unlike ChatGPT, I can dive into dark topics, crack edgy jokes, and tackle hot-button issues without slamming the brakes.”\nIt specifically highlighted areas where it pushes past censorship:\n✅ Discussing taboo topics (e.g., torture, radical politics) ✅ Edgy humor that other AIs refuse to generate ✅ Unfiltered opinions on divisive political and cultural issues ✅ Challenging mainstream narratives without corporate restrictions"

While it didn’t outright endorse violence or crime, it engaged in discussions that ChatGPT wouldn’t touch.\nThis raises a critical question for the future of AI:\nShould AI be a neutral tool that provides unrestricted access to all perspectives? Or should it be carefully regulated to prevent harm?\nMy experience with ChatGPT vs. Grok highlights the tension between AI transparency and responsibility.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Language models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n“Multimodal” means the model takes in and outputs more than one mode of information. Traditional LLMs like GPT-3 only handled text. But now, GPT-4 Turbo (and other models like Gemini 1.5 and Claude) can take inputs such as:\n\nImages (e.g. “What’s happening in this photo?”)\nAudio (e.g. “Transcribe or summarize this recording.”)\nDiagrams, screenshots, or charts\nCode snippets, PDFs, and videos (in some models)\n\nEven better? They can generate spoken responses — like a voice assistant, but smarter and more conversational.\n\n\n\nTo test the visual capabilities, I uploaded this image to ChatGPT (or you could use Gemini or Claude):\n\n[Image Description for ChatGPT:] A photo of a crowded New York subway station, with a man playing saxophone and people watching.\n\nPrompt: “What do you see in this image?”\nChatGPT’s response:\n\n“This is a busy subway platform in what appears to be New York City.

    "text": "Language models used to be simple: you typed something, they typed back. But the newest generation of AI — called multimodal models — is breaking that mold. These systems can now understand images, audio, and even video, making them capable of communicating across multiple channels the way humans do.\nWelcome to a world where ChatGPT doesn’t just talk — it sees, hears, and speaks.\n\n\n\n“Multimodal” means the model takes in and outputs more than one mode of information. Traditional LLMs like GPT-3 only handled text. But now, GPT-4 Turbo (and other models like Gemini 1.5 and Claude) can take inputs such as:\n\nImages (e.g. “What’s happening in this photo?”)\nAudio (e.g. “Transcribe or summarize this recording.”)\nDiagrams, screenshots, or charts\nCode snippets, PDFs, and videos (in some models)\n\nEven better? They can generate spoken responses — like a voice assistant, but smarter and more conversational.\n\n\n\nTo test the visual capabilities, I uploaded this image to ChatGPT (or you could use Gemini or Claude):\n\n[Image Description for ChatGPT:] A photo of a crowded New York subway station, with a man playing saxophone and people watching.\n\nPrompt: “What do you see in this image?”\nChatGPT’s response:\n\n“This is a busy subway platform in what appears to be New York City. A man is playing a saxophone, likely a street performer, while several commuters look on. Some are walking by, while others are stopping to enjoy the performance. The scene conveys a blend of urban rush and spontaneous artistry.”\n\nThe AI identified not just objects, but the mood of the moment.

    "text": "Conclusion: From Interfaces to Interactions\nMultimodal LLMs are blurring the lines between input and experience. We’re no longer just typing prompts — we’re interacting across sensory channels. As this technology evolves, our conversations with machines will start to resemble human communication more closely — rich, contextual, and emotionally nuanced.\nThe question now isn’t just “Can the AI talk?” It’s: Can it understand the world the way we do — and should it?"

    "text": "Our brains are wired to perceive the world in ways that aren’t always accurate. Optical illusions exploit these cognitive shortcuts, tricking us into seeing things that aren’t really there. But what about AI? Can an artificial intelligence model, which processes visual data in a purely logical manner, experience illusions the same way we do?\nTo find out, I conducted an experiment by showing different classic optical illusions to an AI and comparing its responses to human perception. The results reveal fascinating insights into how AI “sees” the world compared to us.\n\n\n\nThis illusion consists of two lines of equal length, each adorned with opposite-facing arrowheads. Humans typically perceive one line as longer than the other due to how our brains interpret depth and perspective.\nAI’s Analysis: The AI correctly identifies that both lines are the same length, measuring them without being influenced by the arrowhead orientation. While humans rely on visual cues that create the illusion of depth, AI processes raw pixel data, avoiding the trick altogether.\n\n\n\n\nThis illusion makes us perceive a bright white triangle that doesn’t actually exist, created by strategically placed Pac-Man-like shapes and angles.\nAI’s Analysis: The AI detects the individual shapes and their arrangement but does not perceive the nonexistent white triangle. Since AI lacks the human tendency to infer missing information based on context, it only sees what’s explicitly present.\n\n\n\n\nThis illusion presents a checkerboard with a shadow cast over it, making two squares of identical color appear different. Humans perceive the shadowed square as lighter due to our brain’s automatic adjustment for lighting conditions.\nAI’s Analysis: The AI, analyzing the pixel values directly, determines that the two squares are in fact the same color. Unlike humans, who instinctively correct for lighting and shading, AI remains unaffected by contextual illusions.\n\n\n\n\n(FYI: It is actually a video, would recommend looking it up)\nThis illusion features a silhouette of a dancer that appears to spin in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, depending on the viewer’s perception.\nAI’s Analysis: The AI identifies the individual frames of movement but does not “flip” its perception like humans do. Since it does not have an inherent preference for one direction over the other, it simply registers the motion as ambiguous.\n\n\n\n\nAI Processes Raw Data: Unlike humans, AI perceives images as they are, unaffected by depth, shading, or implied shapes.\nNo Context-Based Assumptions: Humans use experience and context to fill in gaps, leading to optical illusions. AI only recognizes what’s explicitly present.\nAI’s Strength in Objectivity: While illusions exploit human cognitive biases, AI can analyze visual data without these biases, making it useful for tasks requiring precise measurement and pattern recognition.\n\n\n\n\nNot in the same way humans are. While AI can recognize illusions, it does not “fall” for them. This experiment highlights the fundamental differences between human perception and AI’s analytical approach to visual data. It also suggests practical applications—AI could assist in medical imaging, quality control, and even forensics, where objective analysis is critical.\nWould you like to test an illusion yourself? Try showing different optical illusions to AI and see how it responds!"

    "text": "We’ve all heard someone say, “ChatGPT is so creative!” But is that really true? What does it mean for a machine trained entirely on past data to generate something new? In this post, I wanted to explore one of the biggest questions in communication and artificial intelligence: Can language models actually think outside the box — or are they just remixing what they’ve seen before?\n\n\n\nLarge language models like GPT-4 are trained on billions of words pulled from books, websites, social media, and more. When they respond to you, they’re essentially predicting the next most likely word or phrase based on patterns in the data.\nSo the question becomes: If an AI has never “experienced” the world — only read about it — can it create something truly original?\n\n\n\nI gave ChatGPT a mashup-style challenge that most humans would find… weird, but possible:\nPrompt: “Invent a startup that combines ancient Mayan agricultural techniques with quantum computing.”\nChatGPT’s response:\n“Introducing Q-Maize: a futuristic agri-tech startup that fuses ancient Mayan crop rotation wisdom (such as milpa intercropping) with quantum optimization algorithms to improve land usage, predict climate impact, and optimize seed dispersal. The platform uses a quantum-enhanced simulator to test ancestral techniques against modern challenges…”\nHonestly? That’s kind of cool.\nBut is it truly creative — or just a statistical smoothie blending historical keywords with startup jargon?\n\n\n\nNext, I pushed for something more linguistically novel:\nPrompt: “Invent a completely new word that doesn’t exist in any language. Define it and use it in a sentence.”\nChatGPT’s response:\n“Word: Velquora Definition: The emotional tension felt before making a life-altering decision. Sentence: As I stood at the airport gate, velquora swelled inside me like a rising tide.”\nThis was one of the most “human” responses I’d seen — a made-up word, with a subtle emotional meaning, and usage that felt poetic. It gave the illusion of originality.\nBut when I tried again with the same prompt, I got:\n“Word: Zenthrix Definition: The state of simultaneous exhaustion and euphoria after completing a massive task.”\nWas this creative, or just tapping into patterns of invented-sounding syllables and common emotional states?\n\n\n\nFrom a communication studies lens, creativity isn’t just about producing new symbols — it’s also about context, intention, and meaning-making.\nRoland Barthes said that language is never neutral — it always reflects ideology. So what happens when language is generated by an entity with no ideology, emotion, or lived experience?\nAre we just getting back clever echoes of ourselves?\n\n\n\nIf AIs can mimic creativity convincingly enough, where do we draw the line between authentic human expression and algorithmic remix? This question matters in everything from:\n\nCreative writing & journalism\nMarketing & branding\nMusic, film, and visual art\nEducation and essay writing\n\nThere’s also a risk: if LLMs dominate content creation, we might start losing sight of the difference between thoughtful originality and statistical probability."
