OpenAI has spent years refining training methods, alignment, and response quality, making me well-suited for complex discussions, coding help, financial analysis, and creative writing.\nHowever, DeepSeek has strengths, especially in its open-source nature. Open-source models allow for more transparency and customization, whereas I operate within OpenAI‚Äôs closed ecosystem. Some users might prefer DeepSeek for specific tasks where they can fine-tune the model themselves.\nUltimately, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù depends on what you need. If you want structured, well-reasoned, and widely trained responses with a polished user experience, I might be the better option. If you want a customizable AI with more flexibility (and don‚Äôt mind potential limitations in content filtering or response quality), DeepSeek could be an interesting alternative.\nFollow-up: Keep it simple, yes or no?\nChatGPT: Yes."

Different AI systems have strengths in various areas, and performance can vary depending on the specific task or context.\nThe most important thing is whether I can be genuinely helpful to you.

    "text": "Takeaways:\nChatGPT is confident and will say it‚Äôs better (at least in general terms).\nClaude avoids taking sides and sticks to a neutral stance.\nDeepSeek is humble and straight-up says it‚Äôs not better than GPT.\nSo, are they better than each other? That depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. But if you‚Äôre looking for a direct answer‚ÄîChatGPT is the only one that gave a straight-up ‚Äúyes.‚Äù\nThat being said, can we really take its word for it? Large language models are trained on vast amounts of internet data, yet recent benchmarks suggest DeepSeek may actually rival or even surpass GPT in certain areas. If that‚Äôs the case, is ChatGPT‚Äôs confidence justified, or is it simply biased toward its own perceived superiority? Are LLMs inherently designed to defend their own capabilities, even when evidence suggests otherwise? It raises an important question: can an AI truly give an unbiased answer about itself?"
